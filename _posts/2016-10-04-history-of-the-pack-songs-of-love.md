Sumara gazed out the observation window.

The last weeks had been bloody. They were always bloody at the end of a cycle. 

Top ace captains of every fleet raged ruthless war on each other. Brazenly trespassing onto other fleet territories. Preying on weaker ships. Plundering resources and trophy souvenirs to adorn their hulls. Settling disputes at the end of a gun.

Deep blood feuds were born.  
&nbsp; 

The intergalactic news recognized the top three captains. Those whose warships were most garishly decorated in the trophies of their defeated enemies.

1st. thunder_kiss_65  
2nd. &#19971;&#23431;  
3rd. Prinz_Eugen  

All were of the fleet Elder Drivers. 

All featuring their own pictcasts. Weapons unholstered. Teeth grinning broad-toothed smiles. Standing triumphant over the smoldering ruins of some unfortunate captain. Like whalers leaning proudly against their harpoons, their biggest catch hooked and pulled up alongside their ship. 

Contemptuous. Flagrant. Cruel.

It was a galaxy thirsty for war.  
&nbsp; 

Having finished off Victrix Mortalis, Wolfpack made a good standing for themselves. Solidly securing their own foothold in the galaxy. They were surpassed only by the fleets of Dark Matter Heroes and Elder Drivers.

Wolfpack even gave a strong account of themselves among the top captains. One of the pack's new recruits, OliveOyl, placed herself in 5th. Despite being hospitalized after a ruptured bulkhead smashed into her shoulder and shattered her arm. Lord Commander WarWolff was close behind her at 8th.  
&nbsp; 

Wolfpack was even strong enough to send aid to Dark Matter Heroes. 

Following friendly discussions between Caxy and one of the leaders of Dark Matter Heroes, Citizenband, they reached an agreement. 

RollFizelBeef, Myke, SCVsUnion, Dan_the_man181, and JeffLA would all go over to lend a hand to their new allies. Helping them fend off repeated incursions by the Elder Drivers.

Caxy even brought his own ship out of port and dusted off the console to look over omega pack during the last days of the cycle.

It was an exciting time for Wolfpack. One of growing power. They were strong enough now to use their own fleet as leverage to determine the fate of the galaxy.

Wolfpack would soon make a reckoning.  
&nbsp; 

Sumara had planted her ship along one of Wolfpack's borders. Protecting their fleet with a bristling armament of firepower.

Setting up a defensive perimeter in space is not easy. Ships are isolated, often light years apart, and can be scanned from a sector away.

Trying to escape a battle usually ends in catastrophe. There is a split second before warp jump kicks in where your ship is completely exposed to enemy fire. If the enemy aims a well-placed shot at the warp drive, then kablooey! The warp field collapses around the hull, crushing your ship within it.

Even sending a distress signal is pointless. Help could never reach you in time.  The best you can hope for is that someone sends a shop-vac and good cleanup crew. Or vultures to pick up the scraps.

Space battles are fatalistic. Either your ship survives. Or it becomes a trophy adorning some other ship's wall.  
&nbsp; 

Sumara was attacked first by Cloggster of Clan Zaki. It was a brutal exchange of weapons, but Sumara came out on top. She left the wracked hulk of his ship smoking not far from her position. A warning against further adversaries.

Then she was attacked by &#40614;&#36947;&#22823;&#29275;&#29275; . Then Quansei, Mdff8, and KuKu&#26705; . 

Single-handedly, she defeated them all. Lining the blackened husks of their broken ships in front of her. Like heads mounted on pickets on a castle wall. 

Instead of warding off would-be attackers, the more victories she accumulated then the fiercer she was attacked. A mighty fire-belching dragon that every captain intent on proving his valor was keen to slay.  
&nbsp; 

Sumara was a fierce fighter. One of Wolfpack's best. Her succession of repeated defenses won her recognition across the galaxy, claiming her top prize in the Wolfpack’s Alpha Wolf Contest. 

As well as earning her honorable mention in the Pillaging Scourge & Looting Lunatics starlog contest.

She was a legend.  
&nbsp; 

Sumara looked out the observation window. 

Her ship orbited the planet Xeanus in the border sector. A white star shone around the edge of the planet's sphere. Catching the dunes of desert gold along its surface, under the aqua blue atmosphere. It was breathtaking.

She hadn't forgotten why she had become a starship captain. Launching through the atmosphere at speeds upwards of Mach 23. The galaxy opening before her. Like walking out of a cave through a waterfall. Flying among the stars. Invigorating. Untethered. Free.

Just look at that view.  
&nbsp; 

"Sir, letters have arrived from fleet headquarters."

Sumara leaned back in the captain's chair. Kicking her feet up on the console and luxuriously sinking in the soft fur rug draped across the back. She grabbed the hip flask from her belt.

Roborob set the letters down in a neat stack next to her heel. Careful to not make eye contact. Focusing on some undefined point just over her shoulder. Deliberately looking somewhere else. 

Sumara watched his eyes. Swirling the liquid around in her flask. Sloshing some unidentifiable object around within. Then she took a swig.

Roborob blanched visibily, "I'll leave you to it, sir." He saluted, then speedily exited the bridge.

Sumara smirked. The joke never got old.  
&nbsp; 

She was much loved in the pack. As well as among other fleets in the galaxy. Winning herself the nickname Smelzy among her closest friends.

She was aware of her growing popularity. But having championed the intergalactic contests, her fame was reaching unprecedented proportions. Now she received fan letters of undying love and loyalty from the pack?

"The cat sat on a mat inside a vat with a rat. Hmmmm, poetry. This should prove interesting...."  
&nbsp; 

Smelzy oh Smelzy  
Your eau de toilette is smelly  
Offspring grow in your belly  
Just don't show it on the telly

&nbsp; 

Drink from me  
Lips of red  
Moonlight on the pale skin

Counting her bux and laughing.

&nbsp; 

The Valkyries cries  
Songs of war  
The victors stories  
Striding amongst the pack  
They howl in triumph  
Sumara's bloody glory  
--WarWolff  
&nbsp; 

Опали враги,  
Как осенние листья.  
Восходит звезда.  

All the enemies fell down  
Like the autumn leaves.  
The star is rising.  
--Qtarsis  
&nbsp; 

Sumara is beautiful,  
she's a defence machine,  
better have a bridge,  
all she'll blow you away  
--xEEVEEx  
&nbsp; 

A line of smoke rising  
Sumara is reigning ov'r ashes  
She rules over the sky  
--Smores182  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

By her trailzy

To recognize the smellzy

&nbsp; 

Suma in the Fall,  
Sweet grapes dripping from a glass,  
Enemies cower  
--Machiel
