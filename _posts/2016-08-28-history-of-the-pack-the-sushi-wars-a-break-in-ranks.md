It smelled of rotten fish. Every great alliance was involved.

- Victrix Mortalis
- Clan Zaki
- Pillaging Scourge
- Elder Drivers
- Dark Matter Heroes

The top ace captains had broken their former allegiances and formed together a new alliance, The Sushi Train. Its sole purpose: To topple the mighty S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.

It was ugly business. Dirty tactics were employed on all sides.

Top brass of Victrix Mortalis were leading the strike. Promising high payouts for any ace ship willing to join the Sushi Train. High-ranking captains from both Clan Zaki and Pillaging Scourge quickly took up the summons, crippling and leaving their own alliances defenseless. It was within days that Dark Matter Heroes joined as well.

The Elder Drivers had joined with S.Q.U.I.D. only the week before. The S.Q.U.I.D., in honor of the new allegiance, had culled their numbers. Making room for the more powerful Elder Driver ships. 

But after only a few days, the Elder Drivers betrayed them and broke ranks. Joining with Sushi Train instead. Leaving S.Q.U.I.D. that much weaker than before. Now with huge gaps in their defenses.

The S.Q.U.I.D. were desperate and losing control of the galaxy. It reached out to its former alliances with pleas to refill its missing ranks and fight off the growing threat.

We were one of those former alliances. Wolfpack.

It was all dirty.


Wolfpack officers met in council to determine the future of the pack. It was a grove on Omega, circled by trees, with the moon shining in full through the canopy.

WarWolff, Machiel, DeathLord291, Sumara, Hyten, Seq, and I, ArchNadeom, were all present. Exchanging stories of triumphant victories and beaten adversaries, while we waited for our remaining officers to arrive.

xEEVEEx stepped into the grove. I growled under my breath.

xEEVEEx had cast off his fur cloak, and in its place, was now wearing one of the silk pearlescent mantles belonging to the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.

> "Hello squid," smirked Sumara.

xEEVEEx smiled at his old friend. 
> "The battle for galactic supremacy goes poorly for our allies. The threat of the Sushi Train continues to advance. We joined together before with S.Q.U.I.D. to bring down the Old Drivers. And they have always had our back. They are our friends. Our allies. They call on us now to join their numbers and help fight off this new enemy. I have accepted the call. So long as the war endures, I will stand alongside them and defend our allies, the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet."

> "We are wolves. Not squid," I growled.

> "ArchNadeom, the S.Q.U.I.D. have promoted prosperity throughout the galaxy. Yes at times heavy-handed, but that is to be expected when maintaining an empire. If we do not join with them, then our pack, our lives, our prestige as captains, so far as we know them, may perish. The empire may fall."

> "Let it. We are wolves."

We growled at each other. xEEVEEx and I locked stares. Black eyes burrowing into each other's skull. It was a battle of wills.

It was not a proud moment. 

Only the other officers were wise. Standing aloof. Keeping their silence.


Sumara Of The Stout Heart stepped between us and broke the tension. Placing a hand on both our arms.

> "The arguments have been made. Your counsels have been heard. WarWolff is our leader. Only he can decide the future of our pack."

xEEVEEx and I stepped back and resumed our places among the circle. Still glowering at each other under our brows. 

We awaited the command of our leader. WarWolff. 


Where would we stand in the dark days ahead? Would our packmates remain true? What was the future of Wolfpack?
