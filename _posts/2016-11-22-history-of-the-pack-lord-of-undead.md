&nbsp; 

"Will you step into my parlor?"

Gnasher met ButHow at the docking hatch. 

He cut an imposing figure, standing against the dark interior of his ship. He wore a heavy fur cloak over a steel chest plate. The metal was embellished with flames along the bottom and hands stretching upwards. 

ButHow was dressed in formal uniform. Belt. Buttons. Buckles. Hat under his arm. And proudly on his sleeve, an emblem of his alliance, the Elder Drivers.

Gnasher cast his cloak off one shoulder and displayed the battle insignia on his own arm: a human skull.  
&nbsp; 

"Please, make yourself comfortable," Gnasher gestured toward a chair at the end of the table. "May I offer you wine?"

The room was lit in candlelight. Red heavy drapes hung from the ceiling and walls. Above the mantle place stood a large mirror, ornately framed with gold filigree.

"Uh yes, thank you," ButHow seated himself comfortably in the rich satin cushion. "I hear you were recently promoted to Wolf Lord. Congratulations, captain. That is not a commission that could have been easily earned. Certainly not without friends."

Gnasher smiled as he selected a bottle from the cabinet, "Then you are unfamiliar with Wolfpack. 'Friends' would not be the right word."

"How would you call it?"  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher poured the wine. The liquid was thick and dark. He could see only a hint of red through the glass when he held it up to the candlelight.

One does not broach the topic of betrayal by asking toward the relations of the other's allegiance. The very process of analyzing it would only work towards reinforcing those bonds.

Gnasher did ButHow a courtesy and ignored the question.  
&nbsp; 

"A thought has been plaguing my mind since your first communique," Gnasher said, seguing the conversation. "What do we fight for, you and I? Certainly for our alliances. You for the Elder Drivers. I for Wolfpack.

"But what do we gain by our warfare against each other? You expand your borders into our territory. We encroach on your space in return. You attack our transports for gas and minerals. We attack yours. You destroy our ships. We rebuild those ships and then retaliate against yours....

"What is it all for?"  
&nbsp; 

ButHow paused to consider the question, "I see you and I have been thinking along the same line. It is the reason that I asked to meet with you. 

"Were we younger and wiser, we would have chosen more profitable careers in these times of conflict. Such as ship builders or weapons manufacturers.

"But you and I, these trades are not for us. We are starship captains. Our trade is war.

"If I understand your question, it is not why do we fight? For fighting is in our blood. Rather, it is why do we fight each other? When there are more profitable empires we could battle and plunder together."  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher swirled the wine in his glass. So profit was the angle. 

He had to admit it was well-spoken, assuming their commonalities and voicing a foreseeable shared interest. 

Gnasher raised his glass to ButHow in salute. 

ButHow nodded in acknowledgment.  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher spoke.

"I am familiar of a strategy of the Elder Drivers. 

"To bolster the ranks of another alliance, pushing out less powerful but more loyal ships, to clear room for themselves. And then abandoning that alliance at their hour of need and leaving them that much weaker than before. 

"Such I have witnessed at the hands of your alliance against the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet during the Sushi Wars. It was a clever move to topple the once proud empire."

ButHow beamed. At both the apparent compliment and cunning deception.  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher continued.

"When you speak then of fighting together, I can only assume that you mean fighting among the ranks of the Elder Drivers. 

"For having witnessed such a ploy, Wolfpack would never allow ships once loyal to the Elder Drivers to join its ranks.

"And so your proposal is not to join me in my alliance, but that I join you among yours. For profit."

ButHow nodded his head in agreement, "As you say, it is so."  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher bowed his head thoughtfully, then stood from the table.

"I have made some improvements to the deployment of my boarding crew. I would be humbled to share them with you and get your feedback. It would be a show of good faith between us in any consideration towards a future pact."

"I would be honored to look them over," ButHow responded.  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher pulled back one of the drapes to reveal a winding staircase that led down.

A cold wind blew up from below, wrapping itself caressingly around them. ButHow could see a faint light around the bend, reaching up from the bottom of the staircase.

"Please, after you," Gnasher said to his guest.  
&nbsp; 

Thick cobwebs swayed overhead among the rafters and arches. 

The old wooden boards creaked eerily beneath their feet, as they wound their way down the staircase. When they reached the bottom, Gnasher lifted one of the torches from its sconce.

Long shadows stretched down the corridor. 

The torchlight did not extend far into the darkness. Oozes of black shadow slithered down the cracks of the floors and walls. Seeping toward the disturbance of light.

A strange scratching noise could be heard in the distance.  
&nbsp; 

ButHow hesitated.

"Perhaps we should return. My crew may grow anxious over my absence. I told them I would not be gone long...."   
&nbsp; 

Gnasher stopped and raised an eyebrow.

"You fear the dark? Or that which cannot be seen?

"What does your fear speak of the courage of the Elder Drivers? How would I interpret that fear to reflect their resolve on the battlefield?"

Gnasher looked at him more significantly, "Who would join such an alliance?"  
&nbsp; 

ButHow gulped. 

He could not report back in failure to acquire a new ally because he could not control his fear. It was just a dark corridor. Nothing more.

He lifted his chin and proceeded down the hall.  
&nbsp; 

The resemblance of the ship's interior to a dark castle was unnerving. 

First the richly furnished parlor. Then the wooden staircase and cobwebs. And now even the cool air rising off the stones of the floors and walls. 

The interior was fabricated for effect. 

Furnishings could be replicated from any sales catalogue of the early 20th century. Cobwebs from any pre-interstellar horror film.

The stone facade covered a steel hull. Gnasher's ship was no less impenetrable than any other class 10 ship. But the similarity of its interior to a dark haunting castle was chilling.  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher stopped at a heavy door set in the wall.

The strange scratching noise that had been echoing down the hallway came from the other side of this door.

ButHow felt a chill run up his spine.  
&nbsp; 

"I've assembled them from all over the galaxy," Gnasher said as he grabbed the handle. "They are quite sturdy and make for excellent boarders. I think you may even recognize a few faces...."

Gnasher pulled on the handle. The heavy steel door groaned painfully as it swung on its hinges. As the door opened, the torchlight flickered across the hunched forms of figures shuffling in the dark. 

ButHow could see the stained and faded emblems of Elder Drivers on tattered sleeves. 

"Brains.... brains...."

Gnasher shoved him inside, "Say hello to your new crewmates." Then slammed the door shut.  
&nbsp; 

ButHow beat his fist loudly against the metal. 

"You can't do this! Let me out of here!"

Gnasher leaned close to the steel door and blew a breath of hot air over its cold surface. Drawing a grid with his finger, he began playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against himself.

"Don't be shy, ButHow. Your new friends have been DYING to meet you.

"Get it? Zombies? DYING to meet you? Oh my, I really am too much," Gnasher cackled and wiped a tear from his eye.  
&nbsp; 

For his first move of Tic-Tac-Toe, he placed an X in the bottom left corner. 

"Do you know what a zombie looks for in a first date?"

"Brains.... BRAAAIIIINNNS!"

"That is correct, Zombie! And spoken with such adamance. Hmmmmm, let me try to think up something harder."

Gnasher opposed his move in Tic-Tac-Toe with an O in the top left corner. It was one of only three plays that could counter his opener. He really hated when he stumped himself.  
&nbsp; 

"Have you heard the one about whether zombies eat food with their fingers?"

"Gnash, please! Gnasher! Nooooooooo!!"

"Oh ho, you guys really are too good at these! No is the correct answer. They eat the fingers separately."

Gnasher placed an X in the center of the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.  
&nbsp; 

The stakes were high. 

Gnasher was playing on ButHow's behalf. As his host, it was the best he could offer him. Since Gnasher had already outwitted him once, he certainly couldn't trust ButHow to play well enough on his own.

If Xs won, ButHow would go free and return to his ship unharmed. 

But if Os won or it was a stalemate.... Well, a draw always goes to the defender. Eat up zombies.  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher placed an O in the top right corner. 

Gah! Gnasher kicked the door.

It was the only move O could make to stop the Xs from getting three in a row. It was a question of whether O would slip up and place his marker in any of the other remaining squares. 

But Gnasher was not stupid. He would not make such an obvious mistake.

There were no moves now that would not end in a stalemate.

Gnasher wiped the game away furiously. He could really be a sore loser.  
&nbsp; 

The wild pounding against the door slowly began to fade.

"Well ButHow, it has been fun, but I'm afraid I must go. Maybe we can have dessert later, after I blow up your ship. Let's say around ATE o'clock?"

Gnasher howled throatily. Chortling with laughter, "ATE o-clock? Really? I crack myself up!"

He turned on his heel and walked away. The flickering torchlight receded with him down the hall, as his laughter echoed madly over the quiet sounds of munching.  
&nbsp; 

"Captain on the bridge"

Gnasher swept his fur cloak over one shoulder and sat down hard in the captain's chair.

ButHow was no hapless fly in a spider's web.

Gnasher knew his game before he ever set foot on his ship. He was offended that ButHow had even considered him as someone who might be receptive to such a preposterous idea. That he, a senior officer of Wolfpack, could be persuaded so easily to join the Elder Drivers. As if he would ever leave the pack.

ButHow was a spider. He had just found himself caught in a much bigger wolf's mouth.

At least the zombies seemed to be enjoying what he brought to the table. Gnasher snickered.

"Load the missiles and fire up the lasers. Let's see how well his ship fights without a captain."
