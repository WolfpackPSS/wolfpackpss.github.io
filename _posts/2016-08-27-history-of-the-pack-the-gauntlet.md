It spoke of redemption.

SCVsUnion looked down at his hand.  Or at least, what had once been his hand.  Now it was a metal attachment. A steel prosthetic. A fist of clanking digits and whirling gyros. A robotic imitation of his missing limb. A reminder.

He was still getting used to the neural implants that corded their way up his arm and into his brain. It was a hand that did not feel like a hand. Like he had stuck his arm in a garbage disposal and the metal thing that had clamped down had suddenly become his hand.

Between the pain, the phantom sensations of the missing limb, and the unintuitive way in which the robotics responded, it felt alien. Foreign. Unnatural. It was a reminder.


Weeks before they had spotted a foreign ship moving along the edge of one of their borders. SCVsUnion was on patrol. He had clear orders from Lt. Colonel xEEVEEx to engage any ship that trespassed on Wolfpack territory.

> "Sir, we have identified the ship. It's a class 9 pirate. Hypnosia of Elder Drivers."

SCVsUnion snorted. Elder Drivers? One of the newer alliances. Slowly growing in power. Carving off larger and larger pieces of the galaxy, and growing more and more hungry every day.

Couple of upstarts getting pretty full of themselves. Now they dared to cut into Wolfpack territory?

> "They're a nobody. Destroy them. Follow standard attack procedures. I'll be in my quarters. Find me when the battle is finished."

From the moment SCVsUnion stepped off the bridge, everything went wrong.

The enemy Hypnosia had dropped a Rocky boarder on their ship, that was tearing up their reactors like he was digging for a bone. And while the crew scrambled to repair the damage he unleashed, Hypnosia's guns drilled a hole through their turret.

To make matters worse, the ship's targetting system was on the fritz. And kept bouncing between well-armored systems, rather than exploiting a punctured hole in the enemy's defense.

It was all SCVsUnion could do to get back to the bridge and jump in an escape pod. He reached a hand through the door to press the ship's emergency escape. But as the hull buckled, the automated systems kicked in and the door snapped shut. The crew, the cargo, and his hand, all went down with the ship.

Hulk. Collins. Monk. Da Qiao. Abu. 

All good crewmen. All lost.

SCVsUnion looked down at the metal thing attached to his arm. The Gauntlet. It was a defeat he would not forget.


The Elder Drivers were a build-up of a former alliance. The powerful P.R.C. Fleet. 

Their newness was deceiving. The Elder Drivers were seasoned ships with plenty of battles under their belt from their former days with P.R.C. Fleet. 

As the P.R.C. Fleet fell apart, having suffered heavy losses under incursions from the other alliances, many of its flagships and key officers banded together for survival to form a new alliance. The Elder Drivers.

Slowly closing their ranks, they were reclaiming what had once belonged to the mighty P.R.C. Fleet.

They were scarred. They were bitter. They were not to be taken lightly.


It took weeks for SCVsUnion to assemble a new crew, hardier than before, and get another ship ready for battle. This time a class 10 federation. One of the big rigs. He wasn't messing around.

Just as his ship pulled out of dry dock, an enemy ship was already there to greet him. Hypnosia of Elder Drivers. So we meet again. Must have gotten gutsy after his last victory. Opening fire the moment his ship pulled out.


SCVsUnion flexed the fingers of his gauntlet one by one, then closed them into a fist. He would not underestimate his enemy again.

With the enemy guns pounding on their shields, SCVsUnion stood from his captain's chair and called an assembly. Then walked to the teleporter. 

He did not hurry. He knew his ship. His shields would hold. 

He had prepared a special tactic for just such an attack. He called it, "Defensive Boarding." He knew his enemy well.


The crew were anxious to be standing on ceremony while the ship was under attack. You could hear the barrage of enemy fire chewing away at the shields. The occassional ping as a shot got through to the hull.

SCVsUnion stepped up to the crewman who would make the first boarding. Oliver, in his green power armor. Grabbing the shoulder of Oliver's bandolier of gas grenades, he gave it a tug and straightened them across Oliver's chest. Then gave him a nod.

Boarding an enemy ship was risky business. Suicidal. Boarding plans were prepared before battle. Before you knew the layout of the enemy ship or the arrangement of its crew. You could very well be jumping into a 3-gun salute of your own funeral.

He had picked up Oliver from one of the local taverns. Sitting in a corner, keeping to himself. Everyone giving him a wide berth.

It was the quiet ones you were wisest to fear. They were the most unexpected. The most dangerous.

Now standing before Oliver in the teleporter, ready to board the enemy ship, SCVsUnion spoke no words. Oliver would not hear them. He would accept no praise or commendation for himself ahead of his ship or his pack. His loyalty was fierce.

Standing before him as captain, his presence acknowledging his courage, was the most Oliver would accept.

SCVsUnion did not say the orders. Oliver knew what to do.


Their assault on the enemy ship began the moment Oliver breached the enemy teleporter. He closed his facemask and switched on his suit's internal recirculating air, dropping a grenade of poison gas in the room.

With the enemy crew coughing and disoriented, Oliver quickly exited the room and barred the doors behind him with one of the ship's fire axes. Trapping the enemy crew inside with the deadly gas. He then beelined straight for the enemy hanger.

Their second boarder to the enemy ship, a man the crew nicknamed "The Monkey King", secured the shield room. Effectively destroying the enemy shields. He then headed for the teleporter, eliminating any enemy crew that still remained after the gases had dissipated.

Oliver was met in the hanger room by a third boarder in green power armor. Facemask closed with internal air recirculating, and dropped his own grenade of poison gas.

With the key rooms of the enemy ship secured, SCVsUnion leisurely dismantled the rest of the enemy with his ship's weapons.  This was a victory he wanted to savor.


SCVsUnion was the last to board the enemy ship. The enemy crew had been dispatched and the ship was floating sideways at a weird angle, slowly tilting upwards. Blackened and stripped from the inside out. Little more than a husk of the powerful warship it had once been.

SCVsUnion stepped onto the enemy bridge and placed his gauntlet on the console. 

> "I have redeemed you, my fallen crew. I cannot restore your lives. May I reclaim your honor."

It was a sobering victory. 

SCVsUnion. The Gauntlet of Wolfpack.
