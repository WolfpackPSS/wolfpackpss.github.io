WarWolff stood on the bridge looking out. 

He could see them. Dark blots against the stars. The hulls of one hundred warships. One thousand guns arrayed against him. The mighty armada of Victrix Mortalis. 

WarWolff stood tall on his bridge. Hands clasped behind his back. His cloak was heavy. The thick fur cut with many scars. A dangerous glint in his eye. 

His enemies would rue his name.

WarWolff. Lord Commander of Wolfpack. 

The Great Wolf.  
&nbsp; 

His ship was massive. 

Along with standard lasers and missle bays, WarWolff had outfitted the sides of his ship with two enormous projectile artillery cannons. 200 calibre 64 inch batteries. 

Each barrel was 1060 feet long. Three-and-a-half football fields in length. Firing shells that measured 64 inches in diameter. Almost as tall as a man and twice the size of the largest cannon ball.

The guns were specially encased in a patented 0 Kelvin coolant housing. So much heat was generated per shot that without extra cooling not even the cold vacuum of space could prevent them from melting during operation.

The gun houses, where the crew manned the cannons, were mounted at the rear of the ship. While the barrels were hard-fastened to run along the sides and extend beyond the front. Like two jousting lances held on the back of a horse.

The cannons only pointed forward and could not maneuver on their own, so they required the ship's steering to aim. Also, because of the tremendous amount of firepower they packed with each shot, special timing mechanisms had to be built into the engines to counter the powerful force of kickback from each volley and keep the ship steady when firing.

WarWolff nicknamed them Krupp and Big Bertha.  
&nbsp; 

"Sir, the last of Wolfpack has arrived. The fleet is assembled. Awaiting your orders."

Victrix Mortalis had arranged their armada in a Wall formation. Each ship flying next to the other in a flat line. Wing tip to wing tip. 50 across. 2 ranks deep. One hundred ships.

WarWolff smiled.

The strategy behind a Wall formation was simple. Thin your line and stretch out your ships longer than the enemy host. When the center was struck, the sides would pivot like two doors on a hinge towards the middle. Effectively flanking their opponent.

Its most famous enactment was in the Battle Of Marathon. Where the Athenian army routed and then decimated a superior Persian force. Victrix Mortalis would cast themselves as the Athenians. 

It was as historically significant as it was irrelevant.

Space battles did not operate under the same conventional limitations as a two-dimensional planet. Space was three-dimensional. 

WarWolff smiled grimly. His fleet was not Persian. They were wolves.  
&nbsp; 

"Broadcast my orders across the fleet. Vic Triple-Deck Sleeper formation."

The Vic formation was a standard aerial combat formation. Three ships. One on point. With two further back on either flank. In this case though, the standard ship placements would be filled by full squadrons.

Triple-Deck added two more levels of squadrons. One above and one below. Making the formation three layers high.

The Sleeper squadron flew behind point, nestled among and protected by the other squadrons. It was not a rearguard. It was a special tactics unit. It was meant to harrass the enemy force and make them commit to their plan of attack.  
&nbsp; 

"xEEVEEx, take left flank with SCVsUnion and Voxar. 

Machiel, take right with Librakron and MizzBlaze."

Against a wall formation, the flanks would get hit the hardest. He needed their most powerful ships guarding their sides. xEEVEEx was the most battle-hardened and dependable. Machiel was the strongest, but also unpredictable. He was better positioned where he was most likely to hit enemy ships.  
&nbsp; 

"Sumara and Deathlord291, take top with Ivydocious.

Seq and Hyten, take bottom with Skinkrules."

Top and bottom squadrons were less likely to receive enemy fire. Sumara, Deathlord291, Seq, and Hyten were brilliant tacticians and expert marksman. They worked best when placed in a superior firing position where they could exact maximum damage. They would help thin the enemy ranks while xEEVEEx and Machiel weathered the brunt of enemy fire.  
&nbsp; 

"ArchNadeom, you're on Sleeper with fritz and Qtarsis."

ArchNadeom and fritz were built like skirmishers. Using hit-and-run tactics, they could engage and harrass larger ships for a significant amount of time until one or the other finally came out on top. Qtarsis would help finish off any stragglers. As a Sleeper squadron, they offered what the fleet would need most from them. Time.  
&nbsp; 

"I will take point with \_sharky\_ and CyberWocky."

The strategy of a Vic Triple-Deck Sleeper formation was to hit the opposing force like a wrecking ball. Between the coordinated attack of WarWolff's twin cannons and \_sharky\_'s battering ram, there wouldn't be much left standing after their first frontal assault.

They would smash into the enemy ranks with enough power to break through and then keep sailing at maximum speed before the enemy could close on their flanks. It was a tactic that would depend on force and speed. 

The Sleeper squadron would drop off like a mine sometime before the two forces collided. Fully exposed and totally outnumbered. Dangling like a delicious red cherry off a fruit tree. Visible, yet just beyond reach. 

A tempting target upon which the enemy could redeem themselves after their first battering, while the rest of Wolfpack circled back to enclose on the divided force and now exposed enemy flanks.  
&nbsp; 

"Captains, you have fought for this moment. Months in preparation. Tuning your ships. Training your crews. Bloodied. You tested your mettle in battle. For this moment. 

"Under the shadow of the S.Q.U.I.D. empire, you grew. Against the incursions of Sushi Train, you banded together. Defying the ravages of war, you endured. 

"A scrabble of ragtag ships, you transformed yourselves into a fleet of a lethal fighting force. Where others fell, you endured. For this moment.

"This moment, you will claim your place in the galaxy. This moment, you will look across the battlefield. You will see the enemy armada assembled against you. And you will say, "No more."

"No more will I stand aside. No more will I go unheard. No more will I sit idly by and watch as others tear the galaxy apart. No more will I endure.

"From this moment forth, you captains of Wolfpack will be known."  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff looked out upon the mighty warships in formation around him. xEEVEEx in his powerful emerald federation. Sumara in her aqua dorito-shaped squid. \_sharky\_ with the vicious red teeth painted across his bow.

His fleet. His proud captains. The Wolfpack insignia blazened angrily across their hulls.  
&nbsp; 

"Officers, assemble your squadrons. Remember your orders. Carry yourselves with honor and bring your pack glory.

"Wolfpack, prepare to engage the enemy."
