------------------------------------------------
&nbsp; 

Snow gathered on the branches. Casting shadows under the moonlight. Trough the trees. Fields of white dusted in glittering blue.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff placed a hand against an old wood circling the grove. 

He could feel the coarsness of its trunk. The cuts in its bark and dried sap under his fingers. The stength in its stand, as it towered over him. 

The Elder Circle on Omega.

There was a deep power here. Ancient. Resonating. Echoing with the howls of old wolves. 

He could hear them through the trees. Feel their energy swell inside him. And something else too. Pride. Wolfpack had done well.

WarWolff summoned his pack.  
&nbsp; 

It was a solemn meeting.

Tall figures standing in the snow. Heavy cloaks hunched over broad shoulders. White flecks of snow catching in their fur. 

Sumara bundled in her silk rug. \_sharky\_'s conscience represented in its steel automaton. SCVsUnion flexing the fingers of his guantlet, keeping the joints from seizing in the cold. Oliver standing beside him.  
&nbsp; 

All of the pack were present.

Their breath hit the air in steaming white puffs. Hot. Like snorting hounds.

Black eyes burning.

WarWolff stood in the center. Mighty WarWolff. Lord Commander of Wolfpack. 
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx stood before his commander at attention. The former members of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet standing in a line to his side.

xEEVEEx had instructed them ahead of time. They were to dispense of their pearlescent S.Q.U.I.D. cloaks before the ceremony and arrive in simple white garb.

They felt naked. Exposed. Surrounded by dark imposing figures. Their hot breath. Their fierce gaze. The tall trees looming over them. Stretching them deeper into their shadows.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff look to the side and gave Caxy a nod.

Caxy stepped forward with a bundle of furs in his arms. xEEVEEx stepped from the line and met Caxy at the end. 

It was xEEVEEx who had drawn the S.Q.U.I.D. into their ranks. Helping them find a home among Wolfpack. It was xEEVEEx who had called them to the pack's rescue against Victrix Mortalis.

The honor was his.

He picked up a cloak from Caxy's bundle and draped it over RollFizelBeef's shoulders. 

He smiled at his friend. Then gave him a squeeze on the arm.

One by one, he draped a fur cloak over each of the former S.Q.U.I.D.s' shoulders. Giving each a friendly nod, smile, or a touch on the arm.  
&nbsp; 

The depth of the ceremony was powerful. 

When the cloak settled around their shoulders, they could feel the weight of its meaning. The warmth of its fur against the cold. Their own heat swelling within.

No longer did they feel naked or exposed. It was the warmth of the pack surrounding them. 

They had found a new family. One that recognized their strength. Not only as a pack, but as individuals. And bulstered each other's strengths with that of their own.

No longer would they be cast-out. Disbanded. 

No longer would they be alone.  
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx was proud of his new packmates. Each of them smiling in return. He turned, about to resume his place in line, when WarWolff stopped him.

"Halt." WarWolff gave him a stern look.

xEEVEEx faltered. Uncertain. 

Had he missed something? He had performed this ceremony a dozen times before for new packmates. Though not with such formality. Or for such a large audience. But he was sure he hadn't missed anything. Had he?

WarWolff looked to Sumara and gave her a nod.  
&nbsp; 

Out of Sumara's fur cloak, she drew forth a great helmet.

The metal was glossy black, with a frog-mouth face guard. A plume of horsehair, stark white, flowed long and wild from a spike in the crown.

Sumara carried it to WarWolff. Bearing it on the upturned palms of her hands. Holding it outstretched before her. A relic. Reverential.

It was the Helmet of Stodz.

Stodz the First. Of the days of yore. One of the greatest legends of Wolfpack.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff accepted the helmet from Sumara with a deep bow of his head.

He looked at xEEVEEx and gave a significant look down. xEEVEEx took a knee. WarWolff placed the helmet on xEEVEEx's head. 

The cold metal buzzed to life. Gears whirled and clank shut, fastening the armor in place. Seams lit up and glowed an electric lantern blue.  
&nbsp; 

The helmet was alive multi-dimensionally. 

An alien intelligence entered xEEVEEx's conscience. Finding new neural paths to synapses in his brain that had long lain dormant. Stimulating them to life. Triggering new thought.

It could link wormholes. Circumnavigate black holes to the other side of the galaxy. Hide in the folds of space-time, where reality bent in on itself. Establish new contacts. Surprise his enemies.

The inner workings of space lay revealed to him.  
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx stood. Armor plates extended out from the helmet. Clapping down on his shoulders. Down his back. Across his chest. Armoring his arms and legs.

xEEVEEx had entered into a symbiotic relationship with the helmet. It would die for xEEVEEx. Protecting its host. Guarding his life with its own.

It demanded one thing in return. Loyalty.  
&nbsp; 

A metal rod punched through xEEVEEx's sternum and latched itself painfully around his heart.

xEEVEEx understood the implication, should he ever try to take the helmet off.

He wondered how Stodz had manipulated the thing.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff patted xEEVEEx on the shoulder. Power with sacrifice. 

xEEVEEx had given the best of himself for the pack. WarWolff gave the best of the pack to xEEVEEx in return. The circle was closed.  
&nbsp; 

Sumara kicked open a metal container, "Finally! At least we don't have to worry about the champagne getting warm.

"Don't worry xEEVEEx, I brought a beer bong too. I'm sure I can squeeze a tube through that visor. I've got PLENTY of experience from my days in Bore-Us-With-Books Academy."

The ceremony over, it was time for rough-housing and play.  
&nbsp; 

The new recruits blended in well. 

They were as full of life and strength as his seasoned wolves. They found a natural harmony with their new packmates. And brought so much of their own vibrance and knowledge to the pack.

xEEVEEx had made a great decision bringing them in. He was proud of them. He was proud of his pack. 

He was proud of xEEVEEx.
