Beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there, and the battlefield is the heart of man.
―-Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov 
&nbsp;

Death does not arrive with words of parting.

There are no sweeping overtures. No gentle closing of the eyes or quiet sinking into a peaceful rest. No grand epiphanies. It is not a glimpse into the Unknown.

It is violent. Immediate. Terrifying. Personal. 

Death is the final judgment over life's greatest presumption: that it had a right to live. 
&nbsp;

Qtarsis looked around his ship. They were all dead.

Male Nurse on the floor of the reactor. His hands clutched around his throat.

Roborob and Rocky had boarded the enemy vessel, but their comms had gone silent.

The cannon battery was a slaughter. Most of the crew had rushed there. In a desparate attempt to patch (repair) the hull and thwart incoming fire.

All dead. 
&nbsp;

Now Jessica was dying too. Her pupils unfocused. Her eyes wild with terror. Fighting for every last breath.

Qtarsis held her in his arms. Helpless. 
&nbsp;

Another barrage of enemy fire wracked the hull. It would only be a matter of time before he joined his crew as well.

He looked out the observation window on the enemy ship. Masonobu of Clan Zaki. Former brother-in-arms.

Clan Zaki who had been his home. 
Clan Zaki who sold their honor. 
Clan Zaki who now murdered his crew. 

Qtarsis' eyes burned red. 
&nbsp;

He was an exile of the Sushi Wars.

When Clan Zaki had pawned out their top ships with the other great alliances, to join Sushi Train and overthrow the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet, Qtarsis found himself abandoned.

He walked the corridors and hub centers of the once bustling Zaki starport. Deserted. 

He checked the docks and moorings for their ship leaders. Empty. 

He undocked his ship and circled the perimeter for one last look at a place he had called home. Alone. 
&nbsp;

"Альянс — твоя семья.

Alliance is your family."

Qtarsis had been a proud member of Clan Zaki. He felt the sting of their desertion cut deep. 
&nbsp;

Over the galactic channels, he heard of one alliance that had set themselves apart from the Sushi Wars.

One alliance that had closed its ranks. Lending no significant support to either side. Neither Sushi Train, nor the proud S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.

One alliance that stood together like a rock, despite the winds of chaos that swept around it.

Wolfpack. 
&nbsp;

In a time of uncertain allegiances, Wolfpack had distinguished themselves by a simple declaration of solidarity.

Solidarity. It was a word that spoke powerfully to Qtarsis.

He had found a new home. He would not arrive empty-handed. 
&nbsp;

He had learned of a hidden research facility in Zaki space. Satellite 16. For the Development of Advanced Neuro-Cybernetics.

It was headed by a Dr. Sera. 

She held multiple PhDs in neuroscience, kinesiology, and robotics. She was the resident expert on cybernetic technology and focused her research in the area of prosthetics. To replace severed or amputated human limbs with new and augmented robotic counterparts.

Somewhere along the course of her studies and experimentation though, she went mad. 
&nbsp;

With her numerous breakthroughs and the rapid improvements she was making towards enhanced technology, Dr. Sera began to view the human body as inferior.

She proceeded immediately into human experimentation. 

Working around the clock, she cycled through multiple test subjects to perfect her design. Captives she had purchased from the slave market, a trade now thriving with the disfranchised of war. Indentured. Unwilling. Disposable for the mere fact that their lives were now measured in currency.

Dr. Sera promised that what value life had stripped from them, their deaths would go towards rewarding a higher scientific pursuit.

The screams that echoed throughout her lab did little to gain their confidence. 
&nbsp;

The surgical procedures were invasive.

Dr. Sera found that the cybernetics worked more effectively when connected to the brain through the central nervous system. Nerves would be encased by robotic limbs and fused with the metal appendages like a wire plugging into a circuit board.

The procedure for an amputated subject was to stimulate cellular regeneration of the missing nerves.

The procedure for an unamputated subject was to carefully expose the nerves by cutting away any surrounding tissue. Then discard the rest like an unwanted growth. 
&nbsp;

Because of the necessity to work with the nerve fibers directly and uninhibited, Dr. Sera did not use anesthetics.

The pain was excruciating. 

The heightened sensitivity of an exposed nerve is tremendous. Something as innocuous as a breath of air could trigger instant shock or nausea. If the stimuli was severe enough, it could even cause immediate cardiac arrest.

Her lab echoed with screams.

Dr. Sera grew accustomed to the sound. She familiarized it to the relief a patient may feel after extracting a painful molar. 

Such was how she viewed the extremities of the human body. As deformities to be removed. And replaced with superior technology.

She called it "The Cleansing". 
&nbsp;

Because of the secrecy of the facility, Qtarsis only knew of it as a center for cybernetic advancement.

He was unaware of the details of its research, the unethical nature of its progress, the name of its head scientist, or the state of her mental decay.

Given the mass exodus of Clan Zaki to Sushi Train, he thought it unlikely that the station would be manned.

When he invaded its facility, intent on stealing their research as a pledge of loyalty to Wolfpack, Qtarsis was as surprised to see Dr. Sera as she was him. Hunched over her operating table. Wearing a leather butcher's apron. With a scalpel in hand.

Her surprise though quickly turned to anger at his interruption, and she charged Qtarsis with the scalpel.

A blaster fire singed the air. 
&nbsp;

The look of rage on Dr. Sera's face froze into a comical grimace as she looked down. A black spot slowly swelled outward on her leather apron, darkening the place where her heart had been.

She fell forward facedown.

Qtarsis found himself staring down the crackling point of a hand blaster, now aimed at him.

Jessica, The Raven. 
&nbsp;

He had heard of her only in legend.

She flew a pirate ship called The Liberator. She was infamous for attacking slave traders, robbing them of their profit, and releasing their captives to freedom.

Her crew consisted of three Visiri Capt'ns. 

Reformed slavers. Hard men. They fought to reclaim their self-honor aboard her ship.

Jessica had a piercing gaze. She could measure the mettle of a man over how he responded while held at gunpoint.

Any slavers, who genuinely wished to repent of their misdeeds after their ship had been destroyed, were welcome among her crew. Any who did not, were welcome out the airlock. 
&nbsp;

Qtarsis held out his hands, "Thank you. I owe you debt of gratitude. I was waiting for fork to go with knife."

Ha! Jessica lowered her hand blaster.

She had been pursuing a lead on a buyer whose slaves had been mysteriously disappearing, which led her here to Satellite 16.

Once Qtarsis became aware of the type of research they were conducting, he knew Wolfpack would want no part of it. Neither for its findings, nor the butchery that had furnished them. No one would.

He and Jessica rounded up what captives they could and rigged the station with thermal detonators. Set to blow the moment they departed. 
&nbsp;

It would become a lasting partnership.

Qtarsis spoke with no small disdain of the Sushi Wars, or the slave trade that was being fueled by its devastation. When he discussed Wolfpack and his intent to ally with them, Jessica offered to join as well.

They dropped off the released captives at the next free tradeport. Most were too debilitated or too far gone mentally to be of use aboard a starship.

But one proved able-bodied. And anxious to redeem himself against his aggressors. Roborob.

Qtarsis and Jessica pooled their resources, sold their ships, and upgraded to a class 7 alien warship. 
&nbsp;

When they flew into Wolfpack space, Qtarsis had not thought what to expect. Whatever his subconscious may have conceived, it was certainly not this.

Wolfpack was arrayed for war.

Their black warships floated heavily across space. Bristling with armament. Dark. Dangerous. Menacing. 
&nbsp;

Qtarsis pledged his oath of loyalty to Wolfpack. The words were grim. 

Lord Commander WarWolff draped a heavy fur cloak across Qtarsis' shoulders. Pronouncing him the rank of Hunter. 

WarWolff scowled at him under his brow. Glaring with black eyes. 

Daring him to fail. 
&nbsp;

An explosion in the lower reactor jarred Qtarsis back to the present.

His crewmates were dead. Their bodies littered around the ship. Jessica in his arms. Looking upwards. Gulping for air. 

The enemy Masonobu continued pounding his hull with heavy fire.

"Wolfpack. I will not fail." 
&nbsp;

Something stirred inside Qtarsis. It was quiet at first, but it slowly increased in volume.

It was an old song. Proud.

It sang of a fatherland that no longer existed. On a planet that was no longer habitable.

It sang of seas and icecaps. Woods and fields. It sang of patriotism and glory.

Proud words full of conviction.

It surged through Qtarsis and filled him with strength. 
&nbsp;

He bellowed out the words powerfully. 

It filled his lungs and filled the air. It echoed down the elevator shafts. Bounced off the walls. Surged through the reactors and systems like an electric current.

Full of energy and power.

His voice, loud with song, reverberated throughout the hull. 
&nbsp;

Qtarsis (He) stood and walked to the plasma cannon.

He tore open the side panel with bare fingers and ripped out the power conduit connecting it to the main reactor. He tore open the panel of the auxiliary laser, and thrust the detached power line, now sparking in his hand, into the secondary outlet.

Crackles of electricity arced around Qtarsis. 

His voice swelled with fury. Words leaping from his throat louder and louder. 
&nbsp;

He grabbed the controls of the laser and thrust them to full power. His voice bellowing mightily. Overloading the system and firing a continuous beam that cut across the entire length of the enemy hull.

It was more power than the laser could harness and the gun casing exploded. Throwing Qtarsis back against the far wall.

Preliminary explosions ruptured along the enemy ship where the beam breached its length, before the vessel detonated in one final seismic explosion. 
&nbsp;

"Farewell Masonobu. 

Мы стали врагами не по своей воле.

Only war makes us enemies." 
&nbsp;

Qtarsis pulled himself along the floor and propped himself up beside Jessica. 

He leaned against her. Their arms touching shoulder to shoulder. Her lifeless eyes staring blankly on their last victory together (her last victory / retribution).

As the smoldering ship of Masonobu sunk out of view /(below the viewing window), Qtarsis shared with her in one last gaze /(one last gaze with her). Looking out the observation window. Across the glittering canvas of space.

"Чем ночь темней, тем ярче звезды. [^1]

The darker the night, the brighter the stars."
