I ArchNadeom, Keeper Of Records, write of the first days of Wolfpack.

The galaxy was different in those times. Before it was carved up between the alliances. Before the patriarchs sat heavy on the stars like Titans overshadowing the fates. It was a time of Newness.

You could smell the openness of the galaxy. The freedom of undivided space. Feel the eagerness for the first tournament. See the solar rise over a planet's edge and bathe the galaxy in gold. It was a new dawn.

It was in those times that Caxy and TurdSmoothie, two friends, two warriors, two wolves, struck their hands together in brotherhood and Wolfpack was born. Know their names and remember. 

Caxy of the gold-plated guns, light reflecting off his ship bright like a new star. TurdSmoothie alongside all guns blazing like a mad dog. With their pack behind them. Stodz The First, first victor of the first tournament, single-handededly pounding through wave after wave of enemy ship to claim first trophy and forever a legend. Amah The Tall who stood proudly among his brothers. 

It was before our voices. Before the howl. When our great WarWolff was himself a young pup. And silent as a fleet they flew dark and deadly into battle. Know their names and remember.

Quiet they rest now. No longer does Caxy's gold plates catch the sun. No longer do our enemies fear TurdSmoothie's name. Feel the scar across Amah's hull. What battles have you fought, old wolf? Rest your head on Stodz console. What secrets do you hide? No longer do they run with us among the stars. 

Feel their power. Take their strength. They are your ancestors. Know what it means to be a wolf.

_a-Woooooooo!!!_
