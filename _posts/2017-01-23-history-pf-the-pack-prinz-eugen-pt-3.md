&nbsp; 

Caxy of Wolfpack entered when the doors opened. 

A heavy battle-axe slung across his shoulder. Its vibro-force blades glowing a bright and deadly blue.  
&nbsp; 

"Halt!" One of the guards shouted, stopping him at the door, "Weapons are not permitted here."

Caxy leaned close. Close enough that the guard could smell the aged whiskey on his breath. A dangerous glint in Caxy's eye, "Did you want to try and take it from me?"  

"Let him in," Xin called across the room. "He is escorting the prisoner."  
&nbsp; 

Caxy was the one responsible for the apprehension of the accused. 

It was he who had caught and delivered them up to Xin, after another of their alliance had betrayed their activities.

What he had found aboard their starship was unnatural. An incongruity in the flow of time and space. Like a three-dimensional kaleidoscope that was repeatedly overlapping.

A fracture that the accused had willfully and recklessly sundered in the universe. For their own self-glorification.

It was not something Caxy could attack directly.

His mind refused to process it. He could only respond on a deep and visceral level. 

Revulsion.  
&nbsp; 

Caxy looked back at the accused and scowled. 

He unconsciously wiped his hand down his vest. As if he could wipe away the stain of what he had seen from soiling his mind.

What he would give for another drink.

Caxy would oversee the custody of the prisoner for the duration of the trial. As a representative of Wolfpack, as well as a greater collective interest: 

That justice be served and the space-time restored.  
&nbsp; 

The guard stepped back to allow them entry.

Caxy loosened his grip on his axe and fixed the guard with a grim smile, “Another time.” Then resumed his entrance into the courtroom.  
&nbsp; 

When Prinz_Eugen stepped through the doorway, the room exploded with noise. 

Conflicting howls of cheers and catcalls clashed painfully against each other. Fires burst from a few of the holographic projectors. Their voice coils overheating, as opposing alliances with deep-seated feuds shouted over the top of each other in loud, brazen curses.  
&nbsp; 

"SILENCE!" Xin yelled. Slamming his fist down and hitting a pressure switch.

The voice output of every hologram in the room was immediately cut, dropping the court into an eerie pantomime of its self.

Captains stood on the seats of their chairs. Faces contorted with rage. Mouthing violent, angry screams. But no words coming out.

The other half of the courtroom was weeping openly. Throwing flowers and laurels in the air, which bounced oddly against the barriers of their holograms to fall back at their feet.

Personnel scrambled among the room's tiered seating to put out any fires that had started.  
&nbsp; 

Prinz_Eugen walked leisurely down the aisle.

Hands cuffed before him. His head tilted slightly. Eyes sparkling with amusement. A wry, lopsided grin stretching up one side of his face.

He was flanked by a personal guard of four Elder Drivers. Two on either side. They were the only ones that Xin trusted to actually protect the accused.

Prinz_Eugen stopped in the center of the courtroom and stepped up onto a raised platform.  

He beamed smugly around the amphitheater. Drinking up the attention showered on him like a dry man sucking up water.  
&nbsp; 

"Prinz_Eugen, I will instruct you how this trial will proceed," spoke Xin. 

"Under no condition will you speak. You have no rights here.

"The prosecution will present its case and make formal charges. The defense counsel will then argue on your behalf. After which I will consult with my staff and make a ruling. Either to exonerate you. Or sentence you to punishment.

"No evidence or witnesses will be accepted into this courtroom. You may assume that I have already been familiarized and bombarded with the ample and overwhelming accounts of conflicting evidence and testimonies. I will not have it hinder this trial from reaching a speedy verdict.

"I will make no starting pretense towards guilt or innocence. My judgment will be based on the prosecution and defense, and the strength of their arguments. As well as any prior prejudices I may have leading up to this hearing."

Prinz_Eugen nodded, finding his friends among the crowd and grinning widely.  
&nbsp; 

"You must not have heard me," Xin spoke again. "As I said already, you do not have any rights here. 

"I require neither your little head nod, nor your understanding or acceptance of my due process. If I am inconveniencing you, then you shouldn't have been caught and landed on my doorstep."

Prinz_Eugen's smile faltered and he looked sideways at Xin.  
&nbsp; 

"Good," Xin continued. "Now that I've wiped that smirk off your face, I will be clear. 

"If you were shot dead in this courtroom, then it would still satisfy my only interest towards a quick and decisive conclusion of this trial."  

Prinz_Eugen balked. 

Xin glared hard at him.

Respect. If Prinz_Eugen had no regard towards the seriousness of this tribunal, then there was no reason Xin should either.  
&nbsp; 

Once the accused was sufficiently cowed, Xin looked towards the first counsel.

"Prosecution, you may begin."  
&nbsp;
