"The trial will now come to order. 

"Please adjust your holograph signal to frequency XY443-G2 and rise for the honorable Xin."  
&nbsp; 

Xin stepped into the courtroom. 

The ceiling was domed. The smooth planed surface still showed scarring where the stone had recently been cut.

Tiered seating rose upwards from the center of the room in concentric circles like the Roman Colosseum.  
&nbsp; 

Xin entered the court from the only door in the room. 

His appearance was atypical of the orderly fastidiousness you would expect from someone about to measure out justice. 

He was too young. His hair was blue. And on top of his head was a pair of optic lenses he had lost years ago.

But when Xin stepped between the tiered rows of the amphitheater, he walked with purpose. 

Seating himself behind the judge's bench, you could see a powerful determination in his eyes. An underlying conviction that was belied by his otherwise disheveled and outwardly appearance. 

A pretense once underestimated, would later come to regret.

"You may be seated."  
&nbsp; 

To maintain security of the trial, the location of the courtroom was kept secret. 

The only people present at the actual hearing were SavySoda staff, guards, prosecutor, defense counsel, and the accused.  
&nbsp; 

Captains of the various alliances would be permitted to attend only as holograms. 

Tiny holographic projectors were built into the tiered seating of the amphitheater and evenly spaced apart. They were equipped with synchronized audio and video that could both send and receive digital output.

Each captain was reserved their own individual projector. 

They would appear in the courtroom as a hologram. And observe the trial through a connected swivel camera, that would relay the feed to a VR headset back on their ship.  
&nbsp; 

There was nothing special about the VR technology. 

It was ancient tech that predated space travel. Back when bipedal lifeforms were still planetbound. And still used words like "fast" when talking about their cute little land-skimmers.  
&nbsp; 

The holographic technology, on the other hand, was incredibly advanced.

Huge leaps forward had been made towards further understanding the physics behind light and lasers.

The scientific discoveries occurred so rapidly that they snowballed on top of each other. Resulting in the development of new applied technologies, such as mining probes that could filter matter. Or warp engines that could surpass the speed of light.  
&nbsp; 

Holograms were no longer limited to monochramitic or rainbow color. 

Differing wavelengths of the RGB color spectrums could now be overlapped in a single laser. Allowing for a more precise and wider arrange of color.  
&nbsp; 

That was nothing though compared to the technology behind streaming a hologram in realtime.

A powerful pulse laser would fire a rapid shot every 1/60 of a second. Each shot would hit a beam splitter, which would then divide the laser into two beams: an object beam and a reference beam.

The object beam would reflect light off the subject onto a holographic film. The reference beam would bypass the subject and cast light directly on the film instead.

Mirrors were used to control the pathes of the beams, while a diverging lense would spread our their light across the target.

It was the interference between the two beams that was actually captured by the holographic film. 

When a light of identical wavelengths was cast through the film, it projected a hologram. Three-dimensionally recreating the subject, as recorded by the interference of those two beams.  
&nbsp; 

The size of the laser and amount of power required to holographically record a live person was tremendous.

Starships would retrofit one of their standard-issue mining lasers into a pulse phase modulator.

The light of the laser had to be isolated from the interference of any natural or outside lighting, which would wash out the recording. 

To accomodate, a holographic chamber or black box would be built in front of the laser. Effectively sealing out any unwanted light.

The subject to be recorded would then sit inside this box.  
&nbsp; 

Exposure to the amount of electromagnetic radiation from a laser of this size was extremely hazardous to a person.

Known side-effects included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal disorder, blistering, ulceration, blood hemorrhaging, seizure, molecular and cellular degradation, and cancer.

Not to mention instant distintegration, if the mining laser was not properly recalibrated to discharge as an optical light.  
&nbsp; 

But no one dithered over the warning labels. 

This was the trial of the galaxy. It was certainly worth the risk of a few life-threatening ailments.

Besides, they were starship captains. It was not like they were going to live forever.  
&nbsp; 

Yusi checked the calibration of the projectors in the courtroom. Both he and Eric were responsible for overseeing all holographic imaging.

There appeared to be a problem with one of the projections. The hologram of VladTheBad of Pillaging Scourge kept appearing in odd overlapping layers.

Yusi whacked the projector on the side with his hand. 

The hologram flickered and then rearticulated, before correctly displaying all of Vlad's personas. Stacked side-by-side and one on top of the other. Perfectly replicated, but each moving with its own unique personality and individual autonomy.  
&nbsp; 

Hologram reservations were restricted to officers of the top alliances. Even with holograph technology, there was only so much room in the amphitheater.

Almost all of Wolfpack's (the pack) officers were present. Almost.

Our newest S.Q.U.I.D. recruits had grown nostaligic for their departed home and left to reform the proud S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet. 

We still preserved a close alliance together, and they sat next to us in the amphitheater. I nodded at each of their officers in turn: 

Guybrush Threepwood  
RollFizelBeef  
Sinsinna  
Myke  
DT-1236  
Nausicaa  
Dan_the_man181  
Nightlane  
&nbsp; 

I looked over our own officers in Wolfpack. Heavy fur cloaks. Dark glittering eyes. Grizzled. Dangerous.

I paused over the two empty spots next to me. Hyten. Seq.

I felt their absence.  
&nbsp; 

Xin called out from the bench, "Is ArchNadeom of Wolfpack present?"

I frowned, not glad of the attention. Then stood, "I am, your Honor."  
&nbsp; 

"ArchNadeom, I ask that what you report here today be fair and impartial."

I scowled as I looked around the courtroom, "By impartial, I assume you mean with the same negligence that you license captains to abuse your starships?"

"Don't mince words with me, Wolf. I am familiar with your writing and have read your chronicles. I will not have you use this hearing to further your pack's propaganda. You will either agree to write impartially or I will remove you from these proceedings."  
&nbsp; 

I growled under my breath. Wolfpack responded.

xEEVEEx and Sumara leapt to their feet. Outraged.

SCVsUnion and Deathlord291 both reached for their guns. Instinct taking over. Regardless that those weapons would now be useless.  
&nbsp; 

fritz went ballistic. Howling madly and firing off a wild shot. 

The close-range blast punched a hole through the holographic chamber back on his ship. 

The sudden inrush of outside light disrupted the recording. Exploding his holographic image in the courtroom into a perfect cube of bright light. Before his projector registered an error and shut off. 

Leaving behind an empty spot where once fritz had been.  
&nbsp; 

Gnasher's eyes flashed, but then he leaned back in his chair. 

He had already thought ahead through every possible scenario and determined the most likely outcome. It would not require his intervention.  
&nbsp; 


WarWolff looked across the courtroom and subtly shook his head. 

One of our newest officers, Blood Rain NZ, had managed to infiltrate the court and disguise himself among the present guards. 

Under the collar of his uniform, I could just make out the inked tattoo of a line circling his neck with blood dripping down. As if his head had been cut off and then placed back on his neck. For reasons yet to be disclosed, Wolfpack knew the coordinates of the trial's hidden location.

Upon hearing the verbal offense, Blood Rain NZ took a menacing step towards the bench. 

He stopped at WarWolff's indication. Visibly restraining himself. Before stepping back in line to resume his subterfuge among the court guard.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff then looked over his shoulder and nodded at both Machiel and \_sharky\_. 

They put their holograms on a playback loop, hiding their activity. But the implacation was clear: Wolfpack would not let an affront against its honor go unanswered.  
&nbsp; 

I lifted my head to Xin and carefully nodded. Agreeing to his terms.

xEEVEEx, Sumara, and I resumed our places among the pack.  
&nbsp; 

Xin looked around the courtroom at each of his onhand staff. 

Yusi and Eric on holographic imaging.  
Meng, external turret and ship defense.  
Hai, internal security and detailing guards.  
Thomas, technology and architecture.  

Moonsailor and Vivien on holo-communication.  
Sergei, electronic synthesizer.  
Rob, independent legal advisory.  
&nbsp; 

They had planned for this hearing together. Preparing for any and all contingencies. 

Xin made eye contact with each of them. Acquiring visual confirmation from each that they understood their individual reponsibilities and were ready to proceed with this tribunal.

Then Xin looked gravely at the barred door.

"Send in the accused."
