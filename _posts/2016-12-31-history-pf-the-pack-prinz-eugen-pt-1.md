The trial was presided over by the honorary Xin. Gymnasiarch and Master of Games. Justice Pro Tem.

A trial of this magnitude was unheard of. The charges for war crimes were unprecedented. That there could be a crime greater than the wholesale destruction and mass slaughter of war was unthinkable.  
&nbsp; 

This was not a trial in any conventional sense.

There were no laws over the crimes for which the party was being accused. There was no pretext for deciding between which of a captain's actions could be praised as clever ingenuity. Or denounced for gross and inhumane conduct unbecoming of a starship captain.

There was not even an existing framework by which a judicial body could hold a trial and make a ruling.  
&nbsp; 

Xin was the closest thing to a neutral party that could be found.

He was the directing voice behind the largest ship and weapons manufacturer in the galaxy. Hailed by some as a technological savant, whose innovations had revolutionized the art of ship operations and interstellar conflict. But by others, he was viewed as a wartime profiteer. 

The brand of his company was known by name: SavySoda.  
&nbsp; 

Xin was not an appointed judge. It was not a title he would have ever chosen to aspire to. It was a duty bestowed upon him when the accused party was unceremoniously dumped on his doorstep.

Xin had never sat in deliberation over the guilt or innocence of another man. He had never weighed opposing arguments or contradictory statements. He had no way of proving the truth or validity of any substantiated claims or corroborating evidence.

The culmination of events forcing him into a role of judicial magistrate put a sour taste in his mouth. 

One thing on which Xin did agree. The case needed to be settled quickly and decisively. It was bad for business.  
&nbsp; 

It was a trial of opinion.

Everyone had a point of view. Everyone took a side. 

There was no judgment Xin could make that would appeal to all parties. Or that would not result in a loss towards his company's future revenue. 

No matter how he ruled, he would be hated and despised for that ruling. 

There was not a soul in the galaxy who had not already formed their own conviction towards the accused. Without bias, there could be no jury of peers. 

Xin would rule over the case with undisputed authority. 

And for that service, he would be met with universal loathing.  
&nbsp; 

What would be decided here was not just the judgment of one man. What was to be decided would be the legal ramifications for all future engagements of war. And how any crimes of war would be judged, whether or not that crime was defined by law.

There would be no heroes here.
