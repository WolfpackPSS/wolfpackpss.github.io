&nbsp; 

It was another goodbye.

xEEVEEx summoned us together to announce the parting. Those of us who knew her best. Those of us who would miss her most. Those of us who would feel her absence, no longer flying by our side.

Test girl had gone on to Lost Eden.  
&nbsp; 

It was a galaxy of partings. A captain's term was not long. A couple months at most. A blazing fiery start full of firepower and fervent friendships sharing a common cause. And then they were gone.

Their ships standing as an empty masoleum of the great war power they had once commanded. 

Walking away to disappear in the distant horizon. Good friends departed. Forgotten, but for the glories and friendships they left behind. Those who would remember them most.  
&nbsp; 

Test girl, you only shared one story with me. I was not able to say goodbye. I will do my best to tell your story well:  
&nbsp; 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
&nbsp; 

Red alarms were flashing across the bridge.

Test girl pushed herself up off the console. The display was smashed. She touched her brow. There was a slight cut where her head hit the console. Nothing serious. It could wait.

She remembered feeling an internal explosion rupture the ship. Then the shields dropped and they took a volley of enemy fire at full impact.

She stood and checked on her crew.  
&nbsp; 

Cara was slumped against the systems monitor. Test girl grabbed her by the collar and pulled her back in the chair. Her eyes opened slowly with difficulty and then focused on Test girl's. 

Test girl patted her on the chest, "Cara, bring up the systems and get me a damage report immediately. I need to know what hit us and took out our shields."

Jessica was on the floor. The weapons display was destroyed. Jessica took the brunt of it. Test girl didn't have much hope, but she checked her pulse. Nothing. She squeezed Jessica's arm.

The weapons would have to be controlled individually at each of the weapon rooms. She had trained her crew for this. They were good crew. They wouldn't fail her.

"Sir, systems report the shield generator was destroyed while the shields were still up. Without the generator, the shields dropped immediately."

The generator was destroyed while the shields were up? It couldn't have been hit by enemy fire. Weapons wouldn't have gotten through the shields. It must have come from the inside.  
&nbsp; 

"Cara, patch me through to the shield room."

The bridge doors opened and a Trooper walked in. Test girl's hand dropped to her blaster, then realized it was her Trooper. He looked around bewildered at the disarray.

"Sir, the comms are destroyed. I can't reach them."

Frak. She looked at her Trooper. She only had one runner. She would have to make the message count.

"Cara, fix the communications. I need to be able to talk to my ship. Trooper, head to the teleporter room. Tell Zhang Fei to board the enemy ship and dismantle their shields."

It was their only shot. Even the playing field and bring themselves back into the fight. 

Trooper looked at her, "Sir, enemy shield generators are heavily guarded. If you send Zhang Fei in there, they'll kill him."

Test girl gave her Trooper a hard look. One crew for many. This was battle. She did not like to be reminded of the lives she risked. Nor would she repeat an order.

She gave her Trooper a hard look.

"Yes sir! I will relay your order," Trooper stood at attention and saluted, then rushed out the door.  
&nbsp; 

Test girl rested her knuckles against the cracked display and leaned against the console. 

She would bring her ship through this. She had to. The lives of her crew depended on her. This new strategm was powerful. One they could use against their enemies. She must relay it to Wolfpack.  
&nbsp; 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
&nbsp; 

It was a small vigil. 

xEEVEEx, WarWolff, Sumara, Caxy, Deathlord291, Machiel, Hyten, Seq and I. Standing together on the captain's bridge of WarWolff's great warship. 

We looked out the observation window. Seeing Test girl's proud craft in all its glory. Her last flight into Lost Eden. We watched quietly as her ship flew away.

xEEVEEx put his hand against the glass. 

Sumara wrapped her arms around his and I placed a hand on his shoulder. Deathlord291 and Machiel bowed their heads. Hyten and Seq lit a candle for their departing friend.

There was a tear in WarWolff's eye.

Only Caxy remained stoic. It was another goodbye. He had said so many before.  
&nbsp; 

Goodbye, Test girl. May your journey find you happiness and new friendships.

Goodbye, old friend.
