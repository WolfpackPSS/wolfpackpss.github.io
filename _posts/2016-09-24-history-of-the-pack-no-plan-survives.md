------------------------------------------------
&nbsp; 

It was a touch on eternity.

A pause in the flow of time. A stillness of mind. When a quiet settles in. The senses becoming focused and acute. 

When the little things that did not matter before, suddenly take on a precendence. Colors become brighter. Sound more crisp. Simple words take on a depth of meaning they do not otherwise possess.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff could see the light of the nearby moon. Pouring through the observation window. Touching the ozone in the air and streaming it into rays.

He could smell the metallic tang of the hull. Taste the adrenaline on his tongue. Feel the coarse fur of his cloak against his cheek.  
&nbsp; 

He sensed something else too. Something not of this place. He felt their hush in the room. A presence just beyond his perception.

He could not see them, but he knew they were there. As they were always there. At every decisive moment. Nudging. Lifting him back up. Lending their strength.

The ancestors of Wolfpack.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff closed his eyes and gave them a silent nod.

"Protect my fleet. I have lead them as best I knew how. 

They fight for the honor of the pack. They would honor you still, though they do not know you. As they have honored me. 

"They are good wolves. Grant them your strength. See them through this day."  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff lifted his head and looked out. His gaze falling on the enemy armada before him. Victrix Mortalis. 

His black eyes glimmered.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines to 50% power."

The fleet responded to WarWolff's command as if they were part of his ship. Holding formation. Keeping pace with their Lord Commander as if they were marching drill.

Wolfpack moved as one towards the enemy.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines to 60% power."

There is no drag in space. No airpockets or turbulence. No resistance to slow acceleration. To set a constant speed in space, you would simply fire the engines once and then turn them off. 

To leave the engines running at a constant power does not maintain a constant speed. It continues the acceleration. Propelling the ship onward, faster and faster, as it hurtles madly at wildly increasing speeds.

There are limits to speed even in space, but they are measured in the astronomical.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines to 70% power."

WarWolff could feel the ship vibrating beneath him. A humming noise started in the beams and was slowly beginning to echo in the hull.

The images on the displays began to blur. The crew strapped themselves. Fastening their wrists to the terminals to ensure they still pressed the right keys despite the vibrations.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines to 80% power.

"ArchNadeom, break off formation and halt your advance. Engage the enemy when they come in range. Maintain a tactical retreat."

Orders to an officer were different than those to a capitan. Officers were promoted based on their initiative, ingenuity, and ability to coordinate a squadron of ships.

WarWolff would not be directing this battle from afar. He would be part of the battle. As such, he would only be able to oversee the operations of the fleet to a limited degree. 

He would depend on his officers to think independently. To be there. To respond. To act. To make the quick on-the-spot decisions that would be necessary to carry Wolfpack to victory.

As such, the orders for an officer had to be in terms of strategy and generalization. Allowing ample room for them to command their squadrons and respond to immediate threats as best they saw fit, while still carrying out their orders.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines to 90% power."

\_sharky\_ slowly began to pull ahead of the fleet. 

The massive battering ram on the nose of \_sharky\_'s ship was better suited to close combat. Pulling ahead, he would engage the enemy at the same time as the long-range fire of the rest of Wolfpack. 

WarWolff understood. He was as eagar as his captains to cut his teeth on the enemy. The captains knew their own ships better than he. 

He would not countermand them. He had entrusted them with that authority. To countermand them would be to discredit himself in a misplacement of trust.

\_sharky\_ would draw the enemy's first fire, but that battering ram would serve as much a shield for \_sharky\_ as it would a ram.

Godspeed \_sharky\_.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines to 100% power."

The entire ship was rattling. WarWolff grabbed a hold of the frame surrounding the observation window and began digging his fingers into the metal.

"Gun crew, load the 64 inch shells into the cannons. Fire on my command."

Targeting would be choppy, but with the enemy fleet pressed so tightly together he was sure he would hit something.

The enemy ship Runningman swelled into range. Its black hull growing larger and larger as they drew closer. Filling most of the crosshairs.

"Fire!!"  
&nbsp; 

The twin cannons Krupp and Big Bertha barked powerfully. Belching out two massive shells.

Big Bertha missed, but Krupp hit the side reactor. 

With the velocity of the projectile added to the already incredible speed of WarWolff's ship, the shell dimpled into Runningman's shield and then popped through. 

It mushroomed against the hull, doubling in size. Buckling the frame inward and then tearing off the whole rear starboard side of the ship.  
&nbsp;

\_sharky\_'s attack was not as successful. 

He depended on surprise and hitting the enemy broadside, where he would have a much larger target and need to only compensate for minor adjustments in the enemy's tilt or speed.

But facing the enemy head-on, the slightest change in direction for either ship could result in him missing completely.

At the last minute, the enemy veered to the right. Just before impact. \_sharky\_'s battering ram scraped along the side of the enemy ship. Shaving off the enemy's port-side guns like barnacles under a knife.

Because Victrix Mortalis had arranged their fleet in such tight formations, they did not leave each other much room to maneuver. 

When the ship veered starboard, he collided into another Victrix Mortalis ship. Jostling again the ships next to them. The rank of ships behind them barrelling on top of them in turn. Side into Side. Above and below. 

It became a roadblock of broken ships.  
&nbsp; 

CyberWocky had been following close behind \_sharky\_, riding right on his tail. When the enemy fleet crashed into each other and piled up in front of him, he smashed into the mass of hulls at full-speed. 

Without the extra front armor of \_sharky\_'s battering ram though, CyberWocky's ship crumpled like a can under a sledgehammer.  
&nbsp; 

"Engines at full reverse! Crew, brace for impact!!"

WarWolff's ship slid to a halt only a stone's throw away from the enemy fleet. He was close enough to see the enemy crew flung around inside and the smashed systems through their windows.

A massive explosion rocked WarWolff's ship from the port side.

"Sir, our port cannon has been hit. Enemy fire coming from our left flank."

A mighty behemoth of a ship, flying under the name Brook-Lyn, had wheeled their assault onto WarWolff. The wall formation of Victrix Mortalis was slowly pivoting on its center and closing on Wolfpack's flanks.

"Gun crew, focus your cannons on that pile-up of ships. Clear us an opening.

"xEEVEEx, enemy ships are breaking through our left flank. Hold your position until we can punch through that roadblock."

\.\.\.\.\.

WarWolff's ship was wracked by another heavy barrage of enemy fire from port-side by Brook-Lyn.

"xEEVEEx, respond. Hold that flank!"

"Commander, SCVsUnion reporting. Lieutenant xEEVEEx split formation and flew off. Voxar and I are fending them off as best we can, but we can't hold much longer."  
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx? Abandon his post? In the middle of battle?

"Sir, our port cannon is destroyed. Our shields can't withstand that much firepower. The hull is taking damage."

Krupp was down. WarWolff would have to save any thought on xEEVEEx until later.

"Retarget all weapons on the enemy ship Brook-Lyn. Aim for the missle bays. Roborob, Invader and Guan Yu, board the enemy ship. Take down the reactors and slow her rate of fire."  
&nbsp; 

"Sumara, come in. Redeploy top squadron under Deathlord291 and assume command of left flank. Take Ivydocious with you. Reinforce SCVsUnion and Voxar before our flank collapses."

"Aye aye, Commander!"  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff looked out the starboard-side. 

Machiel fought like one possessed. He was engaging three different enemy ships at once. 

A strange green energy was coiling around the beams from Machiel's lasers. Two of the enemy ships had lit up oddly with green fire that was leaping into space.

WarWolff didn't know how long Machiel could sustain that power, but the enemy wasn't pressing their attack. 

Not far from Machiel, MizzBlaze sat eerily quiet. 

There were no visible signs of weapon scoring on the outside of her hull, but her power was clearly dead. No running lights. No engine impulse. Nothing over the radio. She sat stock-still in space.

Librakron kept his distance. He looked as wary of Machiel as the enemy was.  
&nbsp; 

"Seq and Hyten, take your squadron and form up on our rear.

"ArchNadeom, rejoin the fleet. Extend in a line beyond the rear formation. Do not let that wall close behind us or we are done for!"

"You have our word, Commander."  
&nbsp; 

It did not matter. For all his plans, WarWolff had failed. 

Victrix Mortalis closed around them like a noose. WarWolff had understood the enemy's tactic before battle, but he had charged in anyway. He had sacrificed his fleet.

\_sharky\_'s ship titled upward at an awkward angle. Explosions rupturing along his side.

A torpedo slipped past Sumara's shield. Killing her engine and stopping her ship in its tracks.

Two well-placed shots took out Machiel's forward and aft lasers.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff looked on helpless. His packmates were dying.  
&nbsp; 

"a-Woooooooo!!"

It was a sound like sunlight through the clouds. 

xEEVEEx flew out of the nebula with reinforcements on his wings. The powerful officers and ships of the former S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet! 

Their mighty pearlescent hulls no less diminished by their disbandment.

And something else too. The apparitions of wolves. Wolves howling on the flanks of xEEVEEx and the S.Q.U.I.D. warships. 

Wolfpack's ancestors had accepted them. They were S.Q.U.I.D. no more. From this battle to every battle thenceforth, every pack oath, every pack call, they would be wolves.  
&nbsp; 

They tore into the backs of Victrix Mortalis like a hellstorm. Ships disintegrated whole under the awesome volley of their combined firepower. 

Brook-Lyn disengaged from WarWolff and turned to meet the new threat. He took advantage of her distraction to fire a devastating shell from his remaining cannon Big Bertha into her reactor. 

It triggered a chain-reaction of explosions across the other reactors. Destroying her ship.  
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx and his new wolf squadron fanned out around the edges. Wolfpack rallied its remaining ships. Together, they destroyed the enemy commander Kirkbane before he could respond. 

The enemy fleet routed. Victrix Mortalis lost its hold of power. Wolfpack stood in its place.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff beamed proudly. A cheer erupted from his ranks. There would be celebration in the coming days.
