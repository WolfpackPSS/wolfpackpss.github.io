Captain ArchNadeom. Stardate #230.
----------------------------------
&nbsp; 

It was a time of change.

The Old Drivers alliance had been broken. It was a bloody war. It took the very best of Wolfpack and the very best of S.Q.U.I.D. to band together to overthrow the Old Drivers. You can still see their cracked ships and broken hulls. Scarring the horizon like tombstones of former days.

It was a time for change.

One by one, the old guard of the wolfpack, TurdSmoothie, Stodz, Amah, and others, put down their arms and walked into the distance. No songs were sung. There were no clasps of hand or looks backward. No words were spoken. It was not their way.

It was agreed that Caxy would remain. No longer flying beside his pack, but to counsel. To guide. To lend his heroic crew and voice of wisdom in the dark times ahead. His days for glory were past.

It was a time for new leadership.

The new pack assembled on their home planet Omega. Their fur coats bristling and eyes burning black. Hungry for glory. Omega was a good place to assemble. It was where it all began.

WarWolff stood before them. Tall against the horizon, a full moon casting him in white. Caxy slid off his old mantle, a heavy dark fur cloak cut from battle, and placed it on WarWolff's shoulders. A hand on his shoulder. A hard look in the eye. No words were spoken. It was not their way.

Would he live up to the demands expected of him? Would he bring his pack glory? Would he lead them to triumph over their enemies? These are questions that only a great leader asks of himself. Only a great leader thinks of his pack.

WarWolff knew what was ahead. He could see it in his pack's eyes. Knew what they expected of him.

- **xEEVEEx**  - _The Flint-Eyed_
- **Machiel** - _The Strong_
- **Sumara** - _Of The Stout Heart_
- **DeathLord291** - _The Merciless_
- **Seq** - _Keeper Of The Way_
- **Hyten** - _The Sentinel_

All proud officers of the new pack. He would need their strength in the coming battles.

Following the destruction of the Old Drivers, the S.Q.U.I.D. assumed dominance of the galaxy. The Victrix Mortalis soon became their lackeys, with the strange alien Dark Matter Heroes shadowing every of S.Q.U.I.D.'s moves.

Wolfpack was under a change and could not make such a bid. Clan Zaki, Pillaging Scourge and Wolfpack were left to scrap for whatever was left among a scrabble of lower alliances.

Betrayal. It was not a word that sat lightly for WarWolff. He had joined with S.Q.U.I.D. to take down the Old Drivers. They were his former allies. His friends.

Betrayal. He could see it in his officers' eyes. Too long had they lived under S.Q.U.I.D. rule. Too long had they lived under the shadow of its powerful overreaching arm. He knew what they expected of him.

WarWolff turned to the full moon and raised his fist in the air, _"For the Wolfpack!!"_
