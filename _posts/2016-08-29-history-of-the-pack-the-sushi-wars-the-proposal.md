xEEVEEx was the first among Wolfpack to join in the altercations between the S.Q.U.I.D. Warfleet and Sushi Train.

It began as wars often do. With excitement. Hunger for glory. A chance to prove your mettle in battle. About picking a side and fighting alongside your new brothers in arms. That the war would be over quickly. Your side stand victorious. And count yourself a proud hero among those who had fought. Bloodied. Glorious. Triumphant.

Wars do not go that way.  
&nbsp; 

The moment xEEVEEx stepped from Wolfpack, it closed its ranks behind him. In Wolfpack he was a senior officer. Commanding a position of Lt. Colonel, second only to WarWolff. Now he flew alongside the behemoth titans of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet. He was small. He was rank-and-file. He was cannon fodder.

The Sushi Train was especially gunning for any new recruits the S.Q.U.I.D. may draft into its ranks. They would not allow the S.Q.U.I.D. to bulster their defenses and refill the gaping holes the Elder Drivers had left behind with their betrayal.

xEEVEEx was a small rock attempting to fill a missing brick in a stone wall. Sushi Train hammered him relentlessly. Without his pack behind him, it was all he could do to fend them off.

The brothers in arms who had first joined with xEEVEEx, to answer the summons of their S.Q.U.I.D. allies, were now absent. Deserted. Defected. Or destroyed. He sat alone at a table unto himself. Without his pack. A pawn in a much bigger game.

On the table before him, xEEVEEx rested his hand on his old fur cloak.  
&nbsp; 

The meeting of the pack leaders for the future of Wolfpack was still underway. WarWolff stepped into his ring of officers. Commanding their attention.

"It was I who proposed the super-alliance to dismantle S.Q.U.I.D."

Any enmity between xEEVEEx and myself dissolved immediately. What? WarWolff? The idea for an alliance among the other fleets had came from our commander?

"I met with leaders of the other fleets and proposed that we band together our best ships to surmount the S.Q.U.I.D. war machine. 

"The galaxy has grown stagnant under S.Q.U.I.D. rule. Their high tariffs and heavy taxes are strangling all of our fleets. Wolfpack among them. While S.Q.U.I.D. warships grow stronger by the wealth and continue to solidify their power. 

"Victrix Mortalis took leadership of the initiative and carried it out. It was a pact that leaders of all the fleets agreed to. Clan Zaki. Pillaging Scourge. Elder Drivers. Dark Matter Heroes. And Wolfpack. 

"The S.Q.U.I.D. must come down."  
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx and I looked at each other in disbelief. WarWolff continued.

"I have spoken with Sumara. She has agreed to join the Sushi Train as representative of Wolfpack and uphold our pledge with the other fleets. Just as xEEVEEx serves as a representative of us to our allies among S.Q.U.I.D.

"Any who seek glory and wish to join in the war between S.Q.U.I.D. or Sushi Train have my approval to do so. You will be stronger for it. I will remain in Wolfpack as leader and provide stability for our pack through these difficult times. We will not commit our full forces to either side in this confrontation. 

"Wolfpack will stand apart. We will reserve our ships. We will remain strong while the rest of the galaxy tears itself to pieces."  
&nbsp; 

DeathLord291 stepped forward. 

"I will join the Sushi Train with Sumara. The S.Q.U.I.D. have lorded their dominance over us for too long. I hunger for calamari."  
&nbsp; 

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I looked at each of them in turn. DeathLord291? Sumara? WarWolff? These were our officers. Wolfpack! How could they join with another alliance? ANY alliance?

I was disgusted. I turned on my heel to walk away.  
&nbsp; 

Machiel placed a hand against my chest to stop me.

"ArchNadeom, I will join with you brother to look over our omega packmates. Our hearts are in the pack. Test girl, fritz and SCVsUnion will join with us as well. They are strong ships.

"You and I know the leviathons that are out there. The hulking steel monstrosities floating through deep space. You and I have both faced them. We know the dangers. You know our omega pack stands no chance without our support."

I bowed my head. There were no words against wisdom.

"We are not alone in the galaxy. There are too many alliances for Wolfpack to face them all. WarWolff must gamble with the other fleet leaders to serve in the best interests of our pack. 

"You and I are not diplomats. Our hearts are only in the pack. xEEVEEx and Sumara are our best foreign diplomats. Seq and Hyten are our native representatives here at home. DeathLord291 is just a killing machine."

Both DeathLord291 and I snorted.

"Trust in your pack, ArchNadeom."  
&nbsp; 

"Yeah Arch," smirked Sumara. "Think we'd leave for good and let you have all the puppy snacks?"

We all laughed.  
&nbsp; 

xEEVEEx stepped forward.

"ArchNadeom, you are the most loyal wolf I know."

xEEVEEx unclasped the silver pendant from his cloak. It was of an open wolf's mouth made of silver. It represented his position as leader of omega pack. WarWolff wore one as well made of gold. xEEVEEx fastened the silver pendant to my cloak.

"Look after omega until I return."

I could see in his eyes the battles he had been through. The storms he had weathered. I had always had the pack with me. xEEVEEx was out there alone. The S.Q.U.I.D. cloak he wore. Upholding former alliances. He was a target for everybody.

I looked at him again with new respect. He was a tough dog. He may wear a squid cloak now, but he has the heart of a wolf.

I reached out a hand to clasp his.

"Until you return, brother."  
&nbsp; 

Machiel placed his hand on our's. Then Sumara. Then DeathLord291. Then Hyten, Seq, and finally WarWolff.

WarWolff took up the pack's call. His officers answered.

"For the Wolfpack."

"a-Woooooooo!!!"
