It was a bold move against the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.

Wolfpack had been targetting S.Q.U.I.D. ships for weeks with little gain. Even the lower ranks of S.Q.U.I.D. put up a vicious fight. For every victory claimed by Wolfpack, the S.Q.U.I.D. made them pay with heavy losses. And for each S.Q.U.I.D. defeated, they quickly filled their ranks with newer and yet more powerful ships.

Only the senior officers of Wolfpack, and of them only a few, WarWolff, xEEVEEx, and Machiel, dared to confront the S.Q.U.I.D. fighting elite. We were outgunned. Outnumbered. We were losing.

Only the Stout of Heart took up courage. It was time for a new offensive. One that struck at the heart of the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.

Sumara, senior officer of Wolfpack, was our secret weapon.  
&nbsp; 

She had been planning this attack for weeks, ever since the war began. Carefully selecting and upgrading her systems.

She was to penetrate behind enemy lines and strike at their leader, the oppressive and mighty general of the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet, PuddingTown. By cutting off the head of their leadership, that the ranks of the S.Q.U.I.D. would crumble from within.

It was a dangerous assignment. The S.Q.U.I.D. flew in tight circling formations around their center, protecting their general with a wall of ships. Each ring of defense growing stronger and stronger, and weaving itself more tightly as she would push further in.  
&nbsp; 

WarWolff placed a hand on Sumara's shoulder. 

It was not easy selecting an officer for such a mission. There was just no other choice. The S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet was too powerful for a frontal assualt, as the last weeks of battle had painfully proven. It would require guile and courage to infiltrate the enemy lines. Sumara was their best.

Clasping Sumara's shoulders, WarWolf looked her in the eye and then gave her a powerful hug. He may never see his friend again.  
&nbsp; 

For the mission, Sumara had selected one of the dorito-styled ships that was popular among the S.Q.U.I.D.  "Dorito." She smirked at the name. Her ship would devour plenty of those in the days ahead.

Her captain's chair was covered by a thick rug of the softest fur. By her side, she kept a flask filled with a thick dark liquid and some undefinable thing sloshing around within.

There was a rumor circulating among the ship. Her former firstmate, the Trumpsta, had made the mistake of staring at her chest instead of her eyes as she dictated orders. So she cut out his eyes and saved them as a souveneir in her flask.

Why would she correct them? It kept them focused on their duties. And amused her greatly to see one of her crew go pale whenever she took a sip.  
&nbsp; 

"Sir! We've got something on the scanner."

Sumara stood from her chair and approached the station, "Is it him?"

"Reading the output now, sir.... PuddingTown of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet!"

Finally. Weeks of preparation and crawling behind enemy lines had payed off. The head of the beast. It was a great leviathon of a ship. A federation class 10, fully stocked and bristling with guns and warheads.

"Sir! They've pierced our cover! Enemy ship is opening fire!"

"Shields and weapons to maximum power. Train all guns and missiles on the enemy shields. Slimer, head to the teleporter and prepare for boarding. Let's see if we can pull the tentacles off their king."

"Sir, I'm reporting security breaches in Reactor Rooms 1 and 2."

Sumara snorted. Enemy boarders? Is that the best you've got? 

"Engineering Vehicles and Visiri Capn's, report to the reactor rooms and get them back online. Slimer, board the enemy ship and cut power to their shields. All weapons retarget and train fire on the enemy fusion reactor." 

Let's see how you like that. Two can play this game.

"Sir, our teleporter is sustaining heavy enemy fire!"

"Crew, cease all boarding maneuvers. Engineering Vehicles and Visiri Cap'ns rush to the teleporter for emergency repairs. Time your repairs between enemy fire. We'll cover you as best we can with the shields."

"Sir! Our hull is collapsing! We can't withstand that much firepower. Enemy guns are punching a hole clean through our ship!"

"All crew report to your gun posts! Keep those shells firing and the missile bays full. And keep targeting that reactor! It's a race against death, boys. Make your pack proud. a-Wooooooooo!!!"  
&nbsp; 

It was a battle of legends. Sumara destroyed the great PuddingTown of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet and cut the head off their empire. Wolfpack mounted a full offensive, taking advantage of the confusion and crippled leadership, and nipping at the heels of S.Q.U.I.D. warships as they beat a hasty retreat. 

WarWolff was proud to see his friend again. It was a victory worthy of celebration.

Sumara Of The Stout Heart. Hero of Wolfpack.
