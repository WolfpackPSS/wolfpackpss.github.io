<p> </p>

<p>The Sushi Wars were over.</p>

<p>The intergalactic struggle for supremacy had ended. Every alliance felt the deep tears in loyalty that the war had cost them.</p>

<p>New friendships were made. New enemies were sworn.</p>

<p>Everyone was touched by it. It was like new skin regrowing after a cut. Sensitive. Stinging. Scarred.<br />
 </p>

<p>S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet reclaimed dominance over the galaxy. With a recognition, and now deeper distrust, of the rampant opportunism prevalent among the mercenary ships of its fleet.</p>

<p>The Victrix Mortalis were the most effected. They had decimated their ranks to lead The Sushi Train initiative. It would take weeks for them to refill their numbers. And longer still to recover from the bitter defeat. A victory that should have been their’s.</p>

<p>A lone unknown saboteur had decimated Sushi Train with a single attack. There would be a price on his head.</p>

<p>Suspiciously, the Elder Drivers were the only alliance to come out ahead from the struggle. Pushing out Dark Matter Heroes and closely contending with S.Q.U.I.D. now for power.<br />
 </p>

<p>Wolfpack was not untouched by the Sushi Wars.</p>

<p>Everyone was returning home. Those who had joined in the struggle, a little less sure of themselves than before.</p>

<p>It would take powerful overtures and good-natured ribaldry to overcome any underlying resentment.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this was our greatest strength in Wolfpack. We were fiercely loyal to each other. A quality that transcended any other alliance. We were wolves.<br />
 </p>

<p>Machiel, Test girl, fritz, SCVsUnion and myself were the first to return. Omega was the closest to Wolfpack, so our trip was the shortest.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon to send officers and flagships to omega pack to help watch over the young pups. Given the instability of the galaxy and hostility of the Sushi Wars, we had simply sent a few more ships than usual to protect our growing kin.</p>

<p>As such, the welcomes were brief. A few hugs. A couple pats on the pack. It didn’t matter, it sure felt good to be home.<br />
 </p>

<p>xEEVEEx was the next to return.</p>

<p>You could see the heavy weight on his shoulders. His loneliness among S.Q.U.I.D. The wounds he had suffered at the constant battery of Sushi Train warships.</p>

<p>It did not matter that his allies had won. Without his pack, the victory was empty. Meaningless. His scars ran deep.</p>

<p>WarWolff was wise. He had assembled the officers in full ceremony to receive him. WarWolff, Machiel, Seq, Hyten and I were all present. Heavy fur cloaks. Dark glittering eyes. Menacing. Dangerous. Bonded.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx needed to see us for what we were. Wolves. He needed to see through us what he was. A wolf. We lent him our strength to draw from.</p>

<p>He was with his pack again.</p>

<p>His pack was with him.<br />
 </p>

<p>WarWolff squeezed xEEVEEx’s shoulder and gave him a long stare.</p>

<p>It was a look of knowing. You could see the deep lines around WarWolff’s eyes. The heavy creases in his brow. The painful sacrifices that he too had made for the pack. They were scars they now both shared.</p>

<p>“Welcome home, xEEVEEx.”<br />
 </p>

<p>I stepped forward next, “You’ll be needing this back.”</p>

<p>I grabbed the edges of xEEVEEx’s cloak and pulled them together across his chest, fastening them in place with the pendant of the wolf mouth made of silver. Signifying his resumed leadership over omega pack. I was not gentle.</p>

<p>“May it keep your fur cloak around your shoulders.”</p>

<p>xEEVEEx smiled at me and patted me on the arm.<br />
 </p>

<p>Hyten stepped forward, holding forth (at arm’s length) a squirming, slashing, growling, fluffy, little monster. It was a tiliger cub.</p>

<p>“I looked over your terror while you were away, xEEVEEx. I had a fish tank. It ate them all. I think you would be proud.”</p>

<p>xEEVEEx grabbed the cub, hugging it in his arms and ruffling up the mane on top of its head, as it swat and snapped playfully at his fingers. Hyten looked on with distaste.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx stepped alongside WarWolff, resuming his position among Wolfpack. Awaiting our next officers.<br />
 </p>

<p>Sumara and Deathlord291 were the last to arrive. Looking disoriented and confused. The sabotage and resulting disbandment of Sushi Train took everyone by surprise.</p>

<p>It was good that our pack held together so well during the Sushi Wars. It was what the two needed. Stability. A good strong rock to call home. Wolfpack.</p>

<p>We received them with laughter and gracious hugs.<br />
 </p>

<p>Deathlord291 rubbed his backside, still smarting from a kick, “Dang xEEVEEx! You have one vicious bite. You really caught me with my pants down out there.”</p>

<p>“What do you expect? You were in Sushi Train. You should have picked a better toilet.”</p>

<p>Deathlord291 barked a laugh.<br />
 </p>

<p>We learned from the Sushi Wars. We learned about ourselves. Our loyalties not only to the pack, but towards each other. Wolfpack was stronger for it.</p>

<p>It was good to have us all back together again.</p>
