    <h2 id="stardate-238">Stardate #238</h2>
<p>The Sushi Train was swelling to massive proportions. Bigger and bigger ships were joining the new armada every day. Everyone had a bone to pick with the long oppresive rule of the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.</p>

<p>The Sushi Train had greater numbers. More powerful warships. Greater communication arrays. Drawing more recruits into battle. Bulstering their lines with stronger attack formations. Tightening their ranks.</p>

<p>With the Elder Drivers betrayal, they had effectively divided the S.Q.U.I.D. forces by a third. Sushi Train had routed the remaining S.Q.U.I.D ships back to their empire’s capital, where they now sat entrenched. Their guns bristling to defend their home starport.</p>

<p>A massive armada of Sushi Train surrounded the capital like the metal rings of a bear-trap. Sharp spikes pointing inwards.</p>

<p>There would be a final confrontation. There would be one last engagement between Sushi Train and S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet. For supremacy. For freedom. For the fate of all the galaxy.</p>

<p>There would be an end.</p>

<p>Deathlord291 had joined with Sushi Train to fight in the final struggle.</p>

<p>His ship was a class 10 pirate. Black against the black of space. A skull-and-crossbones painted brazenly in ghostly white across its hull.</p>

<p>He would have been undetected. His ship blended well with the black sky, save when he crossed over a planet or star. But Deathlord291’s strategy was not of surprise. Deathlord291 wanted to be feared.</p>

<p>His enemies could hear him coming from a light sector away. He had mounted powerful speakers on the outside of his ship. Cranking out over 10,000 watts of sound. As he flew into battle, he turned up the volume dial to full blast. Playing the song “Du hast” from an old metal relic band of the 20th century known as Rammstein.</p>

<p>There is no atmosphere in space to dampen the flow of sound. Any ship without built-in audio suppression, would have suffered the force at full impact. Exploding internal systems and seizing the crew with immediate cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>His enemies could hear him coming. But because of his dark camoflauge against space, they could not see where.</p>

<p>The Sushi Wars were prime feeding ground. There were so many ships filling the sky, you could barely see the stars.</p>

<p>Deathlord291 fought like a rock skipping across water. Targeting smaller squid ships and punching a hole through their structure before they could turn to meet the assualt. Leaving each enemy ship to slowly turn upwards in space with internal systems combusting, as he moved on to destroy the next target.</p>

<p>Deathlord291 was Merciless.</p>

<p>One enemy squid flew out to meet the challenge. Cpt. Yami of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.</p>

<p>Deathlord291’s weapons were set to automatically target the missile room of an enemy ship. And to keep firing at that target until they punched a hole clean through to the other side of space. They bored him.</p>

<p>He switched on the monitor next to his console and picked up a joystick. He had recalibrated the feed from his ship’s internal security cameras to display as an old arcade game: Pac-Man.</p>

<p>He had recoded the game and reversed its mechanics. Enemy boarders were the munching round pizza-faced avatars called Pac-Men. His own defending crew were the deadly one-shot ghosts. Blinky. Pinky. Inky. And Clyde.</p>

<p>Deathlord291 huddled over his joystick. Cackling maniacly, 
&gt; “Who’s coming to play?”</p>

<p>Cpt. Yami targeted the lasers on Deathlord291’s ship. Taking down one laser at a time and then moving onto the next. The first boarder he would send was a First Sergeant Xin.</p>

<p>It was the only boarder he would send.</p>

<p>Deathlord291 wore the arm of an old plastic doll around his neck. It was a string of twine wrapped around the doll’s wrist that sort of just hung across his chest. You could see the plastic plug of where the arm would attach to a doll.</p>

<p>I don’t know that Deathlord291 even knew that he wore it. Let alone ask him why. He was certifiably insane. He had the drip-feed of a coffee pot plugged into his arm. A juiced-up caffeine junky. It should have killed him.</p>

<p>His crew were walking animatronics that he had assembled himself out of metal parts and soldered electronics. He put buckets on their necks for heads and painted them with cheery smiling faces.</p>

<p>They were slow and awkward. With jittering movements and popping gears. But they were made of steel. They were tough. They could withstand a fair amount of abuse from enemy boarders before returning fire.</p>

<p>Xin had no idea what he was jumping into. The lights were off when he boarded Deathlord291’s reactor. He could only see by a flashlight, that he had thankfully strapped to the muzzle of his gun before teleporting.</p>

<p>But he could hear them coming. Clanking feet and scraping metal. He detonated the reactor as quickly as he could, before running to the next.</p>

<p>Inky met him there. His bright, painted, cheery face under flashlight was an absolute horror in darkness. It was a brutal exchange of gunfire before Xin could dispatch the robot. By the time he had, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde had arrived to reinforce their fallen friend. Smiling cheerfully. Xin didn’t stand a chance.</p>

<p>Back on Cpt. Yami’s ship, all they heard over Xin’s comm was the sound of gunfire, screams, and the hollow eerie boxed soundbits of an old retro arcade game.</p>

<p>No one else boarded Deathlord291’s ship.</p>

<p>Seeing that Cpt. Yami would send no other boarders, Deathlord291 grew tired of the battle. He flipped his monitor to an old cartoon show: Invader Zim.</p>

<p>Cpt. Yami’s ship was destroyed by his weapons without further acknowledgement.</p>

<p>Immersed as he was, Deathlord291 did not notice the dark shadow that passed over his ship’s stern. Heavily coasting toward the heart of Sushi Train command.</p>

<p>Fleets were linked together by powerful communication arrays mounted on each ship. The arrays acted largely as receivers, but they could communicate with their fellow ships at a limited range. The command ships though, were equipped with powerful relays that could broadcast commands across the entire fleet.</p>

<p>The saboteur that struck at the central command of Sushi Train was unlike anything.</p>

<p>A ship painted with The Sushi Train’s emblem, and boasting their own powerful communication damper, rammed into the fleet’s central command. Immediately silencing all broadcasts across the fleet.</p>

<p>When Sushi Train commanders boarded the traitorous vessel to demand answers, there was no one on board. The ship was a spook. Deserted. Empty. It was a ghost ship.</p>

<p>The Sushi Train fleet, made up of ships like Deathlord291 and Sumara, were engaged in their own separate battles. When each engagement was finished, they would receive their following orders for attack.</p>

<p>But when central command was knocked out, there were no further orders coming.</p>

<p>They would wait. And wait. And wait. Until finally, uncertain of what else to do. They simply flew home to their former alliances.</p>

<p>There was no final confrontation. No last stand. No epic glorious battle. No terms of surrender. No victory or defeat.</p>

<p>It was a war concluded in silence.</p>

<p>With The Sushi Train disbanded, the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet quietly resumed their place of authority over the galaxy.</p>
