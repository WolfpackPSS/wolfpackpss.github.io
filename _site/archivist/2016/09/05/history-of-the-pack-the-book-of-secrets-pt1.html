<p>Â </p>

<p>It was known as The Book Of Secrets.</p>

<p>Machiel had been searching for the text ever since he had learned of its existence.</p>

<p>Written by a great general during the late chinese Spring And Autumn Period, the book was said to contain powerful magic. Dangerous spells that could turn fields into mud. Grass into fire. Metal into sludge. Materialize entire armies out of thin air. Swallow enemies whole.</p>

<p>Only a hundred copies had been made. Written on the cut slats of bamboo, stripped from the shields and spears of defeated enemies. Penned in ink squeezed from the bladders of octopi, cuttlefish and squid.</p>

<p>The books were feared for their secrets. Feared for the powers they could summon. Feared for whatever untold terrors they could pull from another dimension and unleash upon the cosmos.</p>

<p>The emperor looked upon the twisted misshapen form of his general, the green fires leaking from his eyes, and recognized the books for what they were. Evil.</p>

<p>He ordered his lieutenants to gather together all known copies. Throw them in a massive pile. Douse them in kerosene. And burned. All of them. Each and every last malignant manuscript. Burned.</p>

<p>All but one.</p>

<p>One copy survived. Written in the generalâs own hand. Bound together by hair from the emperorâs concubines, who he had executed for failing to carry out his orders. Hidden away in an unmarked tomb.</p>

<p>It was the last copy. The Book Of Secrets. Waiting to be unearthed. Thousands upon thousands of years later. Waiting. Just Waiting. Until one day its secrets would be revealed.</p>

<p>The book was cursed.<br />
Â </p>

<p>Machiel scoffed. He did not believe in old wivesâ tales.</p>

<p>He had not achieved the rank of Wolf Lord because he cringed from danger. Nor would he have acquired the badges he so proudly wore now on his shoulder. Architect. Dreadnought.</p>

<p>He was a brilliant tactician. He had rightfully earned his place among the senior officers of Wolfpack.</p>

<p>He understood the value of knowledge. Of strategy. He pursued any resource that might give him a fighting edge over his enemies.</p>

<p>The Book Of Secrets was written by a masterful general. The book would contain tactics he had used during battle to successfully overcome his enemies. That was all.</p>

<p>When Machiel discovered of the bookâs existence, and then of its location, it became only a matter of timing. Of finding that right moment when he could steal in and claim his prize.</p>

<p>The book was buried in a tomb, deep in the archives of the S.Q.U.I.D. empire. He knew where. It became only a question of when.<br />
Â </p>

<p>It was the end of an era.</p>

<p>Leaders of the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet announced their resignation. After the collapse of Sushi Train, the sudden peace that followed was unsettling. It allowed for reflection. A time for thought. A hard look upon themselves.</p>

<p>No matter how noble their intent for ruling the galaxy, no matter how great their magnanimity, they couldnât escape the truth before them. It was because of their long rule, because of the enmity it had stirred, that had caused a Sushi Train to be born.</p>

<p>It was a truth, once recognized, they could not continue to bear.</p>

<p>And so, one by one, the leaders of the S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet announced the end of their reign. One by one, they slowly filed out and flew their ships from the capital.</p>

<p>It was a long procession. All of the alliances were present. Dark Matter Heroes. Victrix Mortalis. Elder Drivers. Clan Zaki. Pillaging Scourge. A multitude of minor alliances. And Wolfpack.</p>

<p>A band started playing on one of the ships and scattered cheers began to erupt, but WarWolff growled at them. Commanding silence. This was not a celebration.</p>

<p>It was a time for respect. A recognition of the strong leaders before them. An acknowledgment of the profound ways in which they had shaped the galaxy. Of the wars they had fought. The enemies they had withstood. The heavy burdens they had borne.</p>

<p>It was a respect that could only be acknowledged by silence.</p>

<p>Silent nods. Silent salutes. Powerfully grave. The S.Q.U.I.D. leaders passed by.</p>

<p>Zulras<br />
Stormhunter<br />
CORSAIR<br />
Myla<br />
BeefFizelRoll<br />
PuddingTown<br />
Overhauled<br />
Nightlane</p>

<p>One by one, they flew their mighty warships to Lost Eden. Never to return. Never to fly again. Never to fight as one. A respected enemy. A shared ally. A proud fleet.</p>

<p>It was the end of an empire. It was the end of an era.</p>

<p>S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet was no more.<br />
Â </p>

<p>With so many on attendance at the procession, Machiel slipped into the capital unnoticed. Intent on pursuing his search for The Book Of Secrets.</p>

<p>He docked outside the S.Q.U.I.D. archives. The building was fronted by massive white pillars and flowing silk banners.</p>

<p>Huge oxygenators pumped out exorbitant amounts of ozone in front of the building, to create a small open atmosphere that quickly bled out into space.</p>

<p>It was a breathable patio quite literally on the edge of space. It was the kind of waste and opulence that only the wealthy would indulge.</p>

<p>Machiel disembarked from the ship with two of his trusty Troopers by his side and entered the archives.<br />
Â </p>

<p>The interior was enormous. Towering white colonnades stretched from floor to ceiling, with pillars as thick as old growth wood. While beautiful rounded domes of glass arched overhead, providing a full observatory onto the stars.</p>

<p>Machiel ignored the sights while his Troopers looked up in awe. Time was of the essence and he could not afford distraction. He led them into a small recessed alcove in the anterior of the building.</p>

<p>Pressing a tile on the wall, he revealed a secret doorway. It opened onto a staircase that twisted downward into darkness. The foul stench of stagnant water rose up to greet them.</p>

<p>Clapping his hand over his mouth, Machiel stepped inside.<br />
Â </p>

<p>The bottom of the stairway opened onto a wide cavern. Fluorescent lights, old and oddly placed, littered the sides of the stalactites and walls. Flickering on and off like torches under a breeze.</p>

<p>A wooden bridge stretched before them over a river. As they crossed, they could see strange phantasmal shapes floating through the water underneath. Phosphorescent. Ghostly. Ethereal.</p>

<p>Curious, one of the Troopers reached an arm over the rail. Almost casual in response, one of the shapes floated closer to the surface. Mesmerizing. Iridescent like gasoline on water. Eager. Longing.</p>

<p>The Trooper reached out his hand to touch the surfaceâ¦</p>

<p>Machiel grabbed his wrist and looked at him sternly, âDo not touch the water.â</p>

<p>The Trooper gulped and pulled his hand back to his chest, rubbing his wrist. Looking over the rail, he watched as the ethereal shape floated away. Nonchalant. All things would come with time.<br />
Â </p>

<p>After crossing the bridge, they entered a broad chamber with three doors. The Room Of Probability.</p>

<p>Machiel had been forewarned of this room when he learned of the bookâs location. He would be given two guesses to determine the correct door. On his first guess, one of the other two doors would open to be revealed as the incorrect door.</p>

<p>Then it became a question of which of the remaining two doors he would select for his second and final guess. Stick with his original choice? Or choose the other door?</p>

<p>Machiel had prepared in advance by studying the writings of an old probability wizard by the name of Vos Savant.</p>

<p>At the start of the test, all of the doors would share an equal probability of 1/3 chance of being correct. But according to Vos Savant, after the first guess and one of the doors had been eliminated, then the other door would now have a 2/3 chance of being the correct door. Whereas the original selection would only retain its 1/3 probability.</p>

<p>So it was always in your best odds to switch your guess to the other door.<br />
Â </p>

<p>Machiel looked at his Trooper. He had grabbed his right hand. So he hazarded a guess that the right door was not the one that he wanted.</p>

<p>So for his first guess, using a dial on the floor, he selected the right door.</p>

<p>In response, the middle door opened to reveal a black hole. With shadowy tendrils fingering at the opening. Hungry to draw any into its arms. Into oblivion.</p>

<p>Only two doors remained to choose from. Right. His first pick. Or the other door. Left.</p>

<p>Following Vos Savantâs probability logic, Machiel chose the other and now turned the dial to the left.</p>

<p>The left door opened onto a passageway.<br />
Â </p>

<p>They followed the passage down a long hall that opened on a circular room. The room was made of solid concrete. Cold and empty. Except for a stone pedestal that stood in the center.</p>

<p>From a hole in the ceiling, rich light poured down from a blue star on top of the pedestal. Revealing a book. Bathed in pure, glittering starlight and opened to a single entry:</p>

<p>âKnow thyself, know thy enemies.<br />
A thousand battles, a thousand victories.â</p>

<p>Finally! The unmarked tomb. The Book Of Secrets.</p>

<p>Machiel had found it at last.</p>
