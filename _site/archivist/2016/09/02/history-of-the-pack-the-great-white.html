<p> </p>

<p>There is no atmosphere in space.</p>

<p>Objects in light are painfully brighter. Blinding. Objects in shadow become black. A black without variation. Indistinguishable from anything else. Obscure. Invisible.</p>

<p>Without advanced augmented vision, it is difficult to see in space.<br />
 </p>

<p><em>It swam at 200 meters under the sea. Just beyond the field of vision. Where there is little light. Where you were unsure whether you might have seen something? Or was your mind playing tricks with the darkness?</em><br />
 </p>

<p>Captain _sharky_ flew a class 10 squid. The top of the hull was painted a murky green-grey. Along its underbelly, a pale ghostly white. A vicious red grin of white teeth blazened dangerously across the bow.</p>

<p>The smile of Death. A great white shark. _sharky_’s smile.<br />
 </p>

<p><em>It could smell blood in one part per million of seawater. It preyed on the wounded. The weak. The bleeding. The smell triggered a deep primal urge that focused every fiber of its body into one single response: Pursue.</em><br />
 </p>

<p>_sharky_ was specialized in data collection and information processing. It had earned him the rank of Blood Knight among Wolfpack. He could extract minute bits of detail and translate them back into meaningful intel.</p>

<p>He had equipped his ship with a special pair of highly sensitive ducts in the forward bow. They could pick up small particles floating through space and determine their trajectory, speed and alien matter.</p>

<p>When two objects meet, they leave behind a residue of each other on the other’s surface. It is the nature of friction. It was this residue that _sharky_ was sifting for. Manufactured metal. Singed laser fire. Propulsion fuel.</p>

<p>He called them “sniffers”.</p>

<p>When a ship struck these particles, it sent them flying off in opposite directions like a pool ball. All he had to do was trace the line back to its source.</p>

<p>It was how _sharky_ discovered his enemy. Floating along in deep space. Presuming his ship remained undetected. Ruby-Roo of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.</p>

<p>He would discover his presumption was wrong.<br />
 </p>

<p>_sharky_ had equipped the front of his ship with a steel battering ram. Strong armor plates overlapping and stacked on top of each other. Reinforcing the entire forward bulkhead.</p>

<p>Missiles and laser fire worked great for surgical strikes. But _sharky_’s ship was a 45,000 ton juggernaut. The speed at which he pushed the engines was enough to melt the reactors. Nothing could withstand the force of impact he was about to unleash.</p>

<p>He smashed into the hull of Ruby-Roo like a great white hitting a seal and breaking the surface of the water. Powerful jaws clamping down.</p>

<p>Ruby-Roo’s ship bent in half around _sharky_’s hull, hurtling them together madly at a new trajectory. Entangled. Ruptured steel tearing into each other. Locked in battle.<br />
 </p>

<p>_sharky_ had the initiative.</p>

<p>His Interceptors flew out of the hangar like hornets from a kicked hive. Opening fire on the exterior of Ruby-Roo’s ship moments after impact.</p>

<p>Teleporters were unnecessary. With the close proximity and devastation wrecked by the collision, boarders could simply walk onto the other ship.</p>

<p>Following pre-determined attack plans, _sharky_ sent a Slimer to destroy the enemy turrets and ACLs. Following him, Lollita took out the enemy plasma cannons and engines. While his ship’s missiles peppered the enemy’s torpedo rooms. Leaving his lasers to work the medbay and finish off any wounded.</p>

<p>He hit at everything.<br />
 </p>

<p>Jarred. Ship schematics now obsolete. Weapons sluggish to respond. It was all Ruby-Roo could do to mount a counter-offensive.</p>

<p>He noticed a weak spot in _sharky_’s defenses. One of the reactors had been exposed by the breach of impact. Not to mention, the heavy strain _sharky_ had already put on them by red-lining the engines.</p>

<p>“All weapons target the enemy central reactor!”<br />
 </p>

<p>_sharky_ had grafted a wireless network of electroreceptors into his spine and fused them with steel. They could reach out to both his outer hull and internal systems, as well as extend beyond to any nearby relays that were broadcasting commands. Measuring the electromagnetic currents and various audio frequencies that were communicating.</p>

<p>In a very literal sense, he could “feel” space.</p>

<p>_sharky_’s near-omniscient sensory equipment did not fail him. He heard Ruby-Roo’s order and responded immediately.</p>

<p>“The enemy is targeting our central reactor. Golden Boy, you’re with me. We are to keep that reactor online at all costs and keep our weapons firing. Should we fall, Invader, Verunus and Good student, you are to assume our places and protect that reactor.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you’re the captain of the ship! You can’t rush into enemy fire.”</p>

<p>“You heard me. Trooper, you have command while I am away. Gentlemen, you have your orders.”</p>

<p>_sharky_ was one of those rare leaders who would not ask of his crew anything that he would not demand of himself first. First to charge. First into battle. First to fall.<br />
 </p>

<p>It was a lucky shot. A laser blast took him through the side as he was refastening a blown thermal coil and tightening the seal.</p>

<p>Laser fire from a ship’s weapons are not small. It punched a hole through half of _sharky_’s torso. It was fatal. He only had time enough to turn and see Golden Boy severed in half by the same laser beam.</p>

<p>Everything went black. _sharky_ smiled.</p>

<p>Black. It reminded him of space.<br />
 </p>

<p>“Sir, can you hear me? Sir?”</p>

<p>_sharky_ was surprised to wake up. If what he was doing could be called waking up. It was certainly a consciousness, but unlike anything he had experienced before.</p>

<p>“Sir, those electroreceptors you embedded in your spine acted as two-way relays. We were able to use the data they collected to artificially reconstruct your consciousness in the bridge’s central computer.</p>

<p>“Our work is a little primitive by your standards, but with your expertise we thought you could improve on it once we brought you online.”</p>

<p>Ah, that explained it. He felt so much bigger now. The entire ship. A bit stiff, but he could make upgrades. He would need to close those security holes in his relays. The same holes that had allowed his crew to restore his consciousness.</p>

<p>Ruby-Roo? The battle? Golden Boy??</p>

<p>“Sir, we’re reading your thought output on the monitor. The battle was a victory. Your orders carried the day!</p>

<p>“Invader, Verunus and Good student rushed to the reactor room when they saw you fall. Your attack plan took apart Ruby-Roo’s ship piece-by-piece. It sort of just sloughed off our nose when the battle was through.</p>

<p>“But Golden Boy… We could not save him.”</p>

<p>He was a good crewman. _sharky_ would remember his sacrifice.<br />
 </p>

<p>A new host body would be needed to represent himself among Wolfpack. A steel automaton should work. It would seem detached. The black eyes unreadable. The wolf cloak awkward on its shoulders. But considering what he had just been through, he was sure they would understand.</p>

<p>_sharky_ was no longer captain of the ship.</p>

<p>_sharky_ was the ship.</p>

<p>The Great White.</p>
