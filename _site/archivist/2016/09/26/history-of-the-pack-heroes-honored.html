    <h2 id="archnadeom-keeper-of-recordsbrstardate-264">ArchNadeom, Keeper Of Records.<br />Stardate #264.</h2>
<p> </p>

<p>Snow gathered on the branches. Casting shadows under the moonlight. Through the trees. Fields of white dusted in glittering blue.<br />
 </p>

<p>WarWolff placed a hand against an old wood circling the grove.</p>

<p>He could feel the coarsness of its trunk. The cuts in its bark and dried sap under his fingers. The stength in its stand, as it towered over him.</p>

<p>The Elder Circle on Omega.</p>

<p>There was a deep power here. Ancient. Resonating. Echoing with the howls of old wolves.</p>

<p>He could hear them through the trees. Feel their energy swell inside him. And something else too. Pride. Wolfpack had done well.</p>

<p>WarWolff summoned his pack.<br />
 </p>

<p>It was a solemn meeting.</p>

<p>Tall figures standing in the snow. Heavy cloaks hunched over broad shoulders. White flecks of snow catching in their fur.</p>

<p>Sumara bundled in her silk rug. _sharky_’s conscience represented in its steel automaton. SCVsUnion flexing the fingers of his guantlet, keeping the joints from seizing in the cold. Oliver standing beside him.<br />
 </p>

<p>All of the pack were present.</p>

<p>Machiel of the Green Fire<br />
Deathlord291 the Merciless<br />
ArchNadeom, Keeper of Records<br />
fritz of the First Howl<br />
Seq, Keeper Of The Way<br />
Hyten, the Sentinel<br />
Caxy, the All-Father</p>

<p>CyberWocky<br />
MizzBlaze<br />
Librakron<br />
Voxar<br />
Skinkrules<br />
Qtarsis<br />
Ivydocious</p>

<p>Their breath hit the air in steaming white puffs. Hot. Like snorting hounds.</p>

<p>Their black eyes burning.</p>

<p>WarWolff stood in the center. Mighty WarWolff. Lord Commander of Wolfpack.<br />
 </p>

<p>xEEVEEx stood before his commander at attention. The former members of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet standing in a line to his side.</p>

<p>RollFizelBeef<br />
Myke<br />
Nausicaa<br />
Gnasher<br />
Dan_the_man181<br />
JeffLA<br />
Sa ok<br />
Alinea</p>

<p>xEEVEEx had instructed them ahead of time. They were to dispense of their pearlescent S.Q.U.I.D. cloaks before the ceremony and arrive in simple white garb.</p>

<p>They felt naked. Exposed. Surrounded by dark imposing figures. Their hot breath. Their fierce gaze. The tall trees looming over them. Stretching them deeper into their shadows.<br />
 </p>

<p>WarWolff looked to the side and gave Caxy a nod.</p>

<p>Caxy stepped forward with a bundle of furs in his arms. xEEVEEx stepped from the line and met Caxy at the end.</p>

<p>It was xEEVEEx who had drawn the S.Q.U.I.D. expatriates into their ranks. Helping them find a home among Wolfpack. It was xEEVEEx who had called them to the pack’s rescue against Victrix Mortalis.</p>

<p>The honors were his to bestow.</p>

<p>He picked up a cloak from Caxy’s bundle and draped it over RollFizelBeef’s shoulders.</p>

<p>He smiled at his friend. Then gave him a squeeze on the arm.</p>

<p>One by one, he draped a fur cloak over each of the former S.Q.U.I.D.s’ shoulders. Giving each a friendly nod, smile, or a touch on the arm.<br />
 </p>

<p>The depth of the ceremony was powerful.</p>

<p>When the cloak settled around their shoulders, they could feel the weight of its meaning. The warmth of its fur against the cold. Their own heat swelling within.</p>

<p>No longer did they feel naked or exposed. It was the warmth of the pack surrounding them.</p>

<p>They had found a new family. One that recognized their strength. Not only as a pack, but as individuals. And bulstered each other’s strengths with that of their own.</p>

<p>No longer would they be cast-out. Disbanded.</p>

<p>No longer would they be alone.<br />
 </p>

<p>xEEVEEx was proud of his new packmates. Each of them smiling in return. He turned, about to resume his place in line, when WarWolff stopped him. A hand against his shoulder.</p>

<p>WarWolff gave him a stern look.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx faltered. Uncertain.</p>

<p>Had he missed something? He had performed this ceremony a dozen times before for new packmates. Though not with such formality. Or for such a large audience. But he was sure he hadn’t missed anything. Had he?</p>

<p>WarWolff looked to Sumara and gave her a nod.<br />
 </p>

<p>Out of Sumara’s fur cloak, she drew forth a great helmet.</p>

<p>The metal was glossy black, with a frog-mouth face guard. A plume of horsehair, stark white, flowed long and wild from a spike in the crown.</p>

<p>Sumara carried it to WarWolff. Bearing it on the upturned palms of her hands. Holding it outstretched before her. A relic. Reverential.</p>

<p>It was the Helmet of Stodz.</p>

<p>Stodz the First. Of the days of yore. One of the greatest legends of Wolfpack.<br />
 </p>

<p>WarWolff accepted the helmet from Sumara with a deep bow of his head.</p>

<p>He looked at xEEVEEx and gave a significant look down. xEEVEEx took a knee. WarWolff placed the helmet on xEEVEEx’s head.</p>

<p>The cold metal buzzed to life. Gears whirled and clank shut, fastening the armor in place. Seams lit up and glowed in stripes of an electric lantern blue.<br />
 </p>

<p>The helmet was alive multi-dimensionally.</p>

<p>An alien intelligence entered xEEVEEx’s conscience. Finding new neural paths to synapses in his brain that had long lain dormant. Stimulating them to life. Triggering new thought.</p>

<p>It could link wormholes. Circumnavigate black holes to the other side of the galaxy. Hide in the folds of space-time, where reality bent in on itself. Establish new contacts. Surprise his enemies.</p>

<p>The inner workings of space lay revealed to him.<br />
 </p>

<p>xEEVEEx stood. Armor plates extended out from the helmet. Clapping down on his shoulders. Down his back. Across his chest. Armoring his arms and legs.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx had entered into a symbiotic relationship with the helmet. It would die for xEEVEEx. Protecting its host. Guarding his life with its own.</p>

<p>It demanded only one thing in return. Loyalty.<br />
 </p>

<p>A metal rod punched through xEEVEEx’s sternum and latched itself painfully around his heart.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx understood the implication, should he ever try to take the helmet off.</p>

<p>He wondered how Stodz had manipulated the thing.<br />
 </p>

<p>WarWolff patted xEEVEEx on the shoulder. Power with sacrifice.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx had given the best of himself for the pack. WarWolff gave the best of the pack to xEEVEEx in return. The circle was closed.<br />
 </p>

<p>Sumara kicked open a metal container, “Finally! At least we don’t have to worry about the champagne getting warm.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry xEEVEEx, I think I can squeeze a tube through that visor of your’s so you can have champagne too. I’ve got PLENTY of experience from my drinking days in Bore-Us-With-Books Academy.”</p>

<p>The ceremony over, it was time for rough-housing and play.<br />
 </p>

<p>The new recruits blended in well.</p>

<p>They were as full of life and strength as his seasoned wolves. They found a natural harmony with their new packmates. And they brought so much of their own vibrance and knowledge to the pack.</p>

<p>xEEVEEx had made a great decision bringing them in. WarWolff was proud of them. He was proud of his pack.</p>

<p>He was proud of xEEVEEx.</p>
