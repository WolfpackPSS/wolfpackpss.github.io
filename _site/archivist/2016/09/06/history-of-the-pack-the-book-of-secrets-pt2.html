<p> </p>

<p>The Book Of Secrets.</p>

<p>Machiel had been searching for it for years. Finally, here at last. In an unmarked tomb. Buried beneath the S.Q.U.I.D. empire. He had found it!</p>

<p>It spoke of battle. It promised of victory.</p>

<p>The secrets it held. The knowledge it could reveal. No enemy could withstand him. There was nothing he could not do with the book in his grasp.<br />
 </p>

<p>Machiel brushed the back of his hand across his mouth.</p>

<p>He looked around the room one more time. The cold concrete walls. His Troopers standing at the entrance. The stone pedestal. The thick starlight pouring down through the ceiling. The Book Of Secrets bathed in light atop the slab.</p>

<p>He could feel the tension in the air. Himself holding his breath. The excitement. The suspense. Everything he had been pursuing, bringing him to stand here at this one moment in time.</p>

<p>Machiel reached out and dipped his fingers in the circle of light. It was like touching a waterfall. He turned his palm upward into the starlight, as it glimmered caressingly around his hand. Like jets of warm water. Splashing through his fingers and down his wrist.</p>

<p>It felt of pure energy. Joy. Laughter. Rejuvenation. He couldn’t help but smile.</p>

<p>It was an end to his many years of struggle and pursuit. This rich beautiful starlight running through his fingers. His trophy before him. The Book Of Secrets.</p>

<p>He would finally lay claim to the treasure for which he had been searching for so long. Machiel turned his hand over and touched its pages.</p>

<p>The circle was broken.<br />
 </p>

<p>The starlight sucked up into the ceiling. Swallowing the room in darkness.</p>

<p>Down the hall, in the blacks of the shadows, there was a deep rumbling. A moist coolness oozed into the room from the passageway. Riding on the backs of the waves of a low billowing fog.</p>

<p>The Troopers backed away from the entrance with their blasters raised. Machiel stepped down from the pedestal, leaving the book behind, and drew his electro-sword. Slowly they converged together in the center of the room. Standing back-to-back. Huddling beneath what little light still came through the ceiling overhead.</p>

<p>Phosphorescent shapes began to move through the fog. Swimming around the edges. Splashing up and smearing down the walls. Leaving green streaks trailing behind them on the porous concrete.</p>

<p>Menacing, they slowly began circling. Easing towards the center of the room. Circling around Machiel and the Troopers. Weaving between their legs. Sliding up their knees. Finding the soft joints in their armor and oozing in cool fingers.<br />
 </p>

<p>One of the Troopers panicked and started firing wildly at the floor and walls. The shots did nothing. It was all Machiel and the other Trooper could do to restrain him. A single bad ricochet in this confined space could kill any one of them.</p>

<p>Slowly, the fog and phantasms began pouring up the pedestal and into the book. Dark billows of fog and green phosphorescence oozing between the letters. Seeping into the pages. Staining its bamboo darkly like spilled watercolor.<br />
 </p>

<p>When the last of the fog swept past them and into the book, the cover closed on its own.</p>

<p>The tomb became eerily silent. More frightening than anything they had just witnessed. They were afraid to move lest they disturb the peace of any more otherworldly beings.</p>

<p>Machiel carefully walked back to the pedestal, stepping lightly on the balls of his feet. He looked down uncertainly at the book.</p>

<p>It would be a shame to not take it with them. After all the years of searching, despite what they had just seen. There must still be some good in its pages worth salvaging.</p>

<p>He reached out a hand, then paused. Frowning again uncertainly. Then he grabbed the book and picked it up off the pedestal.<br />
 </p>

<p>The circular room was empty.</p>

<p>They walked back down the hallway. Empty. Into the three door room. The middle door still standing open. Just a barren alcove now. Empty. They stepped out onto the bridge. The fluorescent lights were off. The river had stopped running. No shapes swam in its currents. Empty.</p>

<p>As Machiel stepped on the foot of the stairs, he looked back into the tomb. So lifeless now. Whatever dark magic had existed here before, he feared they now carried out with them.<br />
 </p>

<p>He was relieved to exit the archives and climb back onto his ship. He dropped the book on his console and sent his Troopers back to their posts.</p>

<p>“Sir, we’ve got an enemy ship inbound. leoliu86 of S.Q.U.I.D. WarFleet.”</p>

<p>“Release the docking lines and detach from the archives. Shields at full power. Turn the ship 135 degrees to port. Nose up 30 degrees from plane. Thrusters full ahead. Meet them head-on.”</p>

<p>Well that was quick.<br />
 </p>

<p>With the S.Q.U.I.D. leaders retiring, the rest of the warfleet had disbanded. Seeking refuge among the other alliances. Or starting their own anew.</p>

<p>Wolfpack granted shelter to as many ships as its starports could accomodate. Offering them hospitality and a new place to call home.</p>

<p>They were the displaced refugees of a fractured empire. In a galaxy torn apart by war.<br />
 </p>

<p>leoliu86 either refused to accept the disbandment of his fleet. (An alliance he had dedicated his life towards serving.) Was stuck in a pre-programmed automated defense routine. Or was himself looting the coffers of the fallen empire.</p>

<p>Either way, he now engaged Machiel in battle.</p>

<p>“Ready the weapons for fire. Roborob, prepare boarding parties to target the enemy reactors. Fighter pilots, take out the enemy ACLs. Full power to lasers and missiles.”</p>

<p>Machiel opened The Book Of Secrets, “Let’s see what you have for me.”</p>

<p>A green heatless fire rose up from the pages. Swelling up Machiel’s arms and into the console.</p>

<p>Power surges started to sound alarms in the laser systems. Arcs of electricity and sparks began popping from the weapons casements. Rippling with a new unknown power they couldn’t quite contain.</p>

<p>“Open fire! Release that energy build-up before those lasers blow!”</p>

<p>His lasers hammered into leoliu86 with enough force to rock the ship. Green fire crackling around the edge of the beams. Punching clear holes in the enemy shields.</p>

<p>Machiel’s fighters responded immediately and peppered the ship with more gunfire to widen the breaches.<br />
 </p>

<p>Strangely, Machiel’s missle bay 1 started firing EMPs at the enemy reactors. A target that would have zero impact against the enemy ship.</p>

<p>“Missile Bay 1, retarget your EMPs on the enemy lasers. We are not clay pigeon shooting.”</p>

<p>Static. Nothing came back over the comms.</p>

<p>“Missile Bay 1, report.”</p>

<p>Static. Still nothing.</p>

<p>“Trooper, head to Missle Bay 1 and report back to me with their status.”<br />
 </p>

<p>The battle was over in little more than a minute.</p>

<p>leoliu86’s shields were not built to withstand the massive amounts of energy surging from Machiel’s lasers. Once the reactors were distintegrated, his ship became nothing more than a powerless metal bucket floating through space.<br />
 </p>

<p>“Uh, sir? I think you better get down here,” it was Trooper calling from Missile Bay 1.</p>

<p>The battle was a momentous victory, but how Missle Bay 1 had behaved was undismissable. Those EMPs would cost him an arm-and-a-leg to replace. Had it been a stronger enemy, their mistargetting could have cost him the battle. Machiel was not pleased.<br />
 </p>

<p>He walked into Missle Bay 1, “Report.”</p>

<p>“Uh, sir. The missile controls would not respond to our commands. The comms went silent and we couldn’t open the doors. We lost control of the room. The missiles just began firing on their own.</p>

<p>“Sir, I hesitate to say this. It was like it had become…. possessed.”</p>

<p>The Book Of Secrets. Machiel remembered the green fire pouring forth from its pages. Up his arms. Into the console.</p>

<p>What had he brought onboard with them? What had he exposed to his ship and crew?</p>
