    <h2 id="warwolff-lord-commanderbrstardate-271">WarWolff, Lord Commander.<br />Stardate #271.</h2>
<p> </p>

<p>The void had swallowed him.</p>

<p>Utter darkness stretched out before him, so inky and black that it almost had form in the mind’s eye. He had always wondered how complete nothingness was able to bear such crushing pressure on the mind, on the soul. Eyes shut tight against the weight, he exhaled slowly and opened them with purpose. Try as he might, no sight nor sound reached him. There was only this smothering world of nothingness.</p>

<p>ArchNadeom, Keeper of the Histories, Sage, Fury, and Dreadnought. All these titles and glory bestowed upon him, but only one thought ravaged his racing mind, “I must go. This must end!”</p>

<p>He was a Wolf Lord. One of the highest ranking members in WolfPack. Battle-hardened and draped in honours. Yet none of his achievements could hasten his release from this void. He was bound to this fate. But he knew that it would not be for long.</p>

<p>He had been passed an important piece of intel only a short while ago, that if acted upon quickly could garner himself and his beloved pack even more power and leverage in the galaxy. It was vital that this opportunity not be wasted. Time was ticking by and each second was a chance lost. He had to go. He had to act now! With that thought he raised his arms out, tilted his head back, and let loose a raging howl.</p>

<p>“The END!” he roared. With this simple yet bold proclamation, his world exploded into light and chaos.<br />
 </p>

<p>The Grande Odeum was still awash in a cacophony of cheers, clapping, and howls from the multitudes of adoring fans, as ArchNadeom descended the raised dais. He stopped and turned for one final salute before he exited the main stage. The theatre was well over capacity this night. Many of the visiting dignitaries mingled shoulder to shoulder on the standing-room-only platforms with the Pack’s warrior poets, whom so loved a good ballad. His gaze fell down past the platforms to the seating bowl below. They stretched back so far he could barely make out the figures, still standing in applause under the bright spot lights and nova flashes that now burned away the darkness of the void.</p>

<p>“Well done Arch,” a hand clasped his shoulder warmly. WarWolff’s deep voice had a hint of levity in it as he spoke, “He’ll be proud and honoured.”</p>

<p>The two gave each other a small nod of acknowledgment and parted ways. There was no need to say more. They were wolves. That simple acknowledgment spoke in words which can’t be spoken.</p>

<p>ArchNadeom turned and began making his way through the mass of stagehands and devotees that had gathered backstage to greet him. He was surprised at how well his new epic had been received. Not only on Omega, but throughout the sectors and amongst the varying alliances. The ship docks were filled with sleek, luxurious Proxima starjammers, hundreds of old, worn-out cargo skiffs and sloops, even the large tourist galleons jockeyed for space. And that was only the underground port facility.</p>

<p>The orbital ports had never seen the likes of the armada that had descended upon Omega, except at times of war. And even then, it could not match the diversity and size of the fleet of capital ships that now secured every available berth. He had word that even the deep space anchorages were running low on docking space.</p>

<p>He had done well, he chuckled to himself. He knew it would be popular, but hadn’t envisaged just what an impact his writings would have. As he made his way to the back of the theatre, finally free from the small talk, admiration, and glad handing, he glanced up and peered at a holo-vid advertising his reading that evening.</p>

<p>LORD WOLF SAGE ARCHNADEOM’S rendition of ‘The Ballad of the Last Battle of Caxy’ streamed across the screen. As an image of a massive matte black class 10 Leviathan capital ship, with the Lord Commander’s sigil on the stern, hung in the background.</p>

<p>Hard not to have a hit when you have him to write about. He was much loved and respected by all WolfPack, and even amongst the various alliances that populated the known sectors. Respected, loved, and feared. Few could stand against him and hope to win. Even One Three Tombo of fleet Prestige Worldwide had earned a hard-fought respect for Caxy. And Caxy for him. That was his way.</p>

<p>Arch caught himself thinking about war stories, old past glories, and then quickly shook them off. With one last glimpse over his shoulder at the clamour, still echoing down through the tall grey halls that were lined with red granite columns the width of a plasma canon, he silently slipped out a freight door and into the night.<br />
 </p>

<p>He moved across the open courtyard with urgency, but not in haste. The moon had risen above the high polished walls of the Grande Odeum. Spraying its feathery light through the many spires and turrets of the Citadel and across the courtyard like so many white fingers chasing away the shadows.</p>

<p>Silently, ArchNadeom made his way to the far side, where the stone abruptly ended at the foot of a large automated orbital defence platform. The dark grey metal of the defence station rose up above him. Streaks of moonlight ran straight down the barrels of the plasma cannons and arched across the heads of the point defence missiles, as he made his way around to where the platform met the outer edge of the Citadel wall.</p>

<p>Five hundred feet below the rooftops, the plasma lighting of the capital city brightly glared up at him. He turned and stared up at the bulk of the Citadel that still hung above him, as it climbed up past the Grande Odeum and the other buildings on the third bench. The vast, flat, angular wall sections, made of the same dark grey metal as the defence platforms, rose up and up; only broken by other platforms and the second and primary benches, until it blended into the geography of the cliff wall that supported it all. Higher and higher it rose on the cliff into the sky, metallic yet subdued and dark, until it finally peaked and the great rocky roof of the Wolf’s Head formation arched its maw out and over the whole Citadel some 300 feet.</p>

<p>“Into the mouth of a giant stone wolf,” Arch grinned. The Citadel was old. Very old. Throughout the ages, many additions and upgrades had been made. From the massive zero point energy reactors, sunk a mile below the bedrock, to the gardens and courtyards that flourished everywhere you looked. The Citadel was a place of nature and beauty, but it was also a weapon. Every nook, cranny, and corner, hosting an array of cannons, turrets, and missile defences, made the Citadel one hard target. It had never fallen. The old captains joked that you could crack the planet in two before cracking the Citadel. Looking up in wonder and pride, Arch felt it to be true.</p>

<p>A quick retinal scan and the heavy door to the defence platform slid open. The smell of old half-eaten protein ration packs and Lupis ale wafted out to greet him. He was just about to enter when he was stopped by a familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Always love the stories but hated the attention, hey Arch?” The words were blunt but filled with merriment, “Can I come this time?”</p>

<p>His head slightly drooped. Without turning, he quietly spoke, “You know that I like to operate alone. My whisperers don’t trust anyone and they spook easily… And this is one time that I cannot afford to make a mistake.”</p>

<p>He slowly pivoted on his heel and his friend came into view, “I promise next time you can fly with me, but not this time Sumara.”</p>

<p>He squared up to her, looking her up and down. The neck of her great Wolf Lord’s cloak brushed up against her cheeks and fell away off her shoulders, flowing back behind her legs and revealing a small woman in formal battle attire. She had really gone all out for the nights festivities, he mused. She wore bluish-grey armour plates, strategically covering a dark red Coridian groot leather tunic, and leggings that were a good match for the formfitting black knee-high boots, slashed with more armoured shin-plates.</p>

<p>She was quite a sight to behold. Intimidating and deadly, while small and beautiful. The WolfPack’s red-toothed Fury belt adorned her waist, the Vanquisher gold-worked bracers wrapped her forearms, and most striking, the black-and-silver crisscross chest harness that denoted she was the elite of the elite. She was a Dreadnought.</p>

<p>ArchNadeom’s hand went up instinctively and rested on his own black-and-silver chest harness. How many ships had fallen before them collectively? How many lives and glories cut short by just these two Wolfpack Dreadnoughts?</p>

<p>The question flittered from his mind as Sumara spoke, “I understand Arch.” She murmured, not making any attempt to hide her displeasure and disappointment, “You must do what you must, but know that I have your back if you need it.”</p>

<p>“I always know you do. And I you. But I must decline this time. This is far too delicate an affair to chance anything.” To be completely honest, he wouldn’t have minded some backup. He did not know what to expect on this mission. Such was his lot in life. He had weathered all challenges previously. This time would be no different.</p>

<p>“Take care of yourself,” she beamed and wrapped him in a short, fierce embrace. She released him, then started backing away with a smile and nod. He nodded, turned, and passed through the doorway into the gloom of the defence platform, when he heard Sumara whisper, “Be careful when dealing with him. He’s the only one I know of that has reliable transit maps of the Aulux sector.”</p>

<p>ArchNadeom spun around, his black fur cloak casting a vast arc swirling around him,” How did….?”</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence hung in his mouth, as he stared across a vast empty courtyard. There was no sign of Sumara, or that she had ever been there. He glanced around, straining for some sign of her, but it was not to be. He shook his head in wonderment. Then threw his head back and burst into laughter.<br />
 </p>

<p>The air whooshed around him as the levels passed. Plasma lights blinked in and out of existence through the large metal frame of the cargo elevator, as it picked up speed descending down, down, and further down into the Citadel.</p>

<p>ArchNadeom often used the defence platform munitions elevators to navigate the warren of buildings and people in the fortress. When not at war, these shafts were not in use. One could get from the top of the Citadel to the reactor cores in a fraction of the time of the main transportation hubs, and without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>But the cores were not his destination this day. This day, he was heading to WolfPack’s subterranean starport. A sprawling network of caverns, protected from orbital bombardment hundreds of feet beneath the bedrock of the surface. It housed the berths of capital ships, destroyers, and frigates of the Wolfpack fleet. And his own beloved ship.</p>

<p>Yes, best if no one noticed him leaving this time.</p>

<p>But how had Sumara known? His mind raced, struggling for answers that did not come. He had received the encrypted message through the neural implant of his personal comm array aboard his ship, The Harvester. He hadn’t spoken to anyone of it, not even the Lord Commander. So how did she know about the Aulux sector?</p>

<p>The munitions elevator growled as it slowed its descent and eventually stopped. The mesh door slid up with a screech of metal on metal and he peered out, across the massive rocky interior of the fleet’s starport. The port was quiet.</p>

<p>A handful of automated SCVs flew around the great hulk of warships. The glow of their cutting lasers illuminated sections of the battle-scarred hulls like electric bumblebees. But otherwise there was little movement or signs of life. Perfect, he thought.</p>

<p>He wound his way through the starport. Over walkways anchored into the stone walls of the caverns, through filling stations, and past docked space tugs and ammo dumps, until he came to a smaller cavern that branched off the main port. As he rounded the corner, the sleek, glistening, black-and-red hull of The Harvester rose up in front of him. Deadly lances of missile tubes and cannons sprouting from the sides, auto turret and ACL barrels bristling like a centurion’s helmet, and large round communication pods hung off the aft like a clutch of eggs.</p>

<p>She was a good ship. Solid and dependable. A captain couldn’t ask for more. And yet, many wondered why he hadn’t moved up to a capital class vessel? All captains as decorated as him should have a capital ship surely, and yet ArchNadeom flew a class 9 destroyer?</p>

<p>His reasons were simple and they were his own. He was not only the Wolfpack historian, but he was also their chief information officer. As such, he often benefitted from the lower visibility that a smaller ship granted. If a destroyer pulled into a foreign port, people didn’t pay much mind, thinking it was a routine patrol or scouting mission. But when a capital ship transited into a system… Well, everyone and their dog knew about it. Which drew far too many eyes and questions for his line of work. He liked working behind the scenes and the shadows suited him.</p>

<p>Another bonus was that many capital ship captains, on seeing the smaller class 9 destroyer, were inclined to think that this was a soft target and easy plunder. Typically finding out, right before their reactors went critical and they themselves were vented out into the cold black of space, that this was not the case. He wasn’t a Dreadnought because he was easy meat.</p>

<p>“Hello old girl,” he chimed. A smile reaching his eyes, as he moved up the gang plank and into the main airlock,”It’s time to get to work.”<br />
 </p>

<p>As he entered the bridge of The Harvester, his first mate Rocky greeted him with a low measured, “Captain on deck.” For a rock, he was quite the intellectual himself, but would never admit it openly.</p>

<p>ArchNadeom unclasped his fur cloak and dropped it from his shoulders. Removing his Dreadnought harness, he flung it casually into an unoccupied terminal chair. Followed by his red-toothed Fury belt, Sage Wolfhead medallion, along with all the other trappings of lordship and rank. He pulled an old, worn, leather trader’s vest over a simple black wool shirt, and slumped down in the large captain’s chair in the center of the bridge. Looking much the vagabond and less the esteemed sage of just hours ago.</p>

<p>“Jessica, fire up the comms array. Protocol 119. All shadow channels. Run secured deep encryption through main holo display,” he barked. “Lock it down and give me the bridge.”</p>

<p>His crew filed out of the bridge without a word, as the blue lines of the holo screen coalesced in front of him and gained form. Side screens flared into life and data started pouring in as the comm arrays whirled, drawing more and more energy, and steadily reaching full power. A deep, resonating hum vibrated through the main keel of the ship. Through the walls and bulkheads, into the bridge, up the body of the captain’s chair, and into his back and arms.</p>

<p>Some very smart people had built the large, customized array that channeled all detectable communications in the sector through his main terminal. He thanked them silently. The power the array drew was enormous and tasked the fusion reactors to their limits. But with it, he could track every conversation and all data that flowed between every ship, civilization, and colony. He had it all laid out before him in streaming lines of data. Immense quantities of information waiting to be gazed upon.</p>

<p>He did not know how Sumara had known of the Aulux sector. It was more commonly known as the Furrow. A dark and dangerous stretch of space.</p>

<p>Long ago, it had been the home of an advanced alien civilization that had destroyed itself in a cataclysmic civil war. The best scientists of the day were still trying to work out what matter of weapons were used that could leave behind rends in space-time thousands of years later. These floating rends would rip a ship into base atoms, if contacted, and were not detectable by any known means. That, and the widely fluctuating gravimetric fields, made the Furrow a warren of death and mayhem. Any sane captain, and most insane captains, would avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p>But the Furrow was also a realm of lost ruins and advanced technology, and that always drew in a special breed. The smugglers, the criminals, the looters and scavengers, the down-on-their-luck looking for a last chance against all odds to make one payday that would set the course of their lives. It was diving into madness and chaos, and that’s where he needed to go.</p>

<p>Into the Furrow.</p>

<p>There was only one person he knew of, who had their fingers burrowed into the secrets of the sector even deeper than he. Only one that had the resources to map out a credibly safe transit map and get him to where he needed to go. His nemesis and rival in intelligence.</p>

<p>They had often worked in opposition to each other. Playing their own pieces in a great game, and even coming to blows ship-to-ship on the odd occasion. Once speaking of him, WarWolff had made an offhand joke about his intelligence capabilities, referring to him as ‘Mr Universe’, since he was everywhere, while being nowhere. ArchNadeom had not laughed.</p>

<p>He sat sourly looking at the holo screen, then angrily punched in a series of commands on his chair’s console. The screen lit up with a data transmission signal and he waited. His face hard but composed, until a solid tone sounded that the signal was in the clear.</p>

<p>He loathed what he was now forced to do. He would have to acquiesce to his great rival and ask for a favour, “Hello, Vlad.”</p>
