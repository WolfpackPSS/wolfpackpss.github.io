<blockquote>
  <p>Enemy boarders have taken the first lower reactor. What are your orders, sir?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was supposed to be an easy target. They picked up the scan from the last starport. A fat merchant vessel heavy with minerals and gas. But that wasn’t what was waiting for them when they jumped into the sector.</p>

<p>Out of the nebula, with full guns blazing to greet them, was a class 10 squid mercenary–S4G3 of Federation. It had been a setup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enemy guns targetting the second forward reactor. Sir! What are your orders?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crew had responded admirably and jumped to their battle-stations. But it didn’t matter. The enemy ship had the drop on us.</p>

<p>Our captain, the Evil General, was the first to launch a boarding party against the enemy shield. But as soon as the teleporter opened, he was met with a smoking las-cannon. fritz looked down at the gaping hole in the General’s chest.</p>

<p>The General had been a good tactician. Hard, but he had the men’s respect. Rest well, you old dog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fritz, sir! You are captain now! What are your orders?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was Thing 1 talking. The General had picked him and his brother up in a dive bar on one of the outer sectors, slugging it out fist-for-fist with the locals. They were a couple of cyborgs, with whirling gears, robotic arms and mechanized organs.</p>

<p>Problem was, you couldn’t tell them apart. So the General had nicknamed them Thing 1 and Thing 2, after some old trashy nursery rhyme. There was a reason he was called Evil.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The shields can’t hold! The second forward reactor is taking heavy damage!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our ship was only a class 6. Totally outmatched against the barrage of enemy firepower facing us. With S.Q.U.I.D. holding dominance over the galaxy and upgrading their fleet to the new class 10s, there were a lot of older squid models lying around.</p>

<p>The galaxy was not a safe place. A simple conversation with another ship could quickly escalate into an exchange of fire. Massive gang alliances had cut up the sectors and prowled hungrily on ships stranded in space. You did not want to fly alone.</p>

<p>We had joined with omega pack for a time. It was a younger sister alliance of Wolfpack. Young pups full of life. As yet, untested and unscarred by the cold brutality of space. But what they lacked in experience, they made up for with energy.</p>

<p>I still think on them fondly. Always proud to meet an omega packmate.</p>

<p>Then, battle-hardened and ready to test our mettle against the outer sectors, we moved up into Wolfpack. Sleek black ships. Dark heavy fur coats. Smoldering black eyes burning with a deeper fire. Grim. Dark. Menacing. Dangerous.</p>

<p>Meeting a fellow Wolfpack is always a heavy affair. Filled with deep respect and powerful oaths of allegiance to the pack. They still give me the shivers. Glad they’re on our side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second forward reactor is down. Third mid reactor is under heavy fire!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>fritz looked up from the Evil General’s dead corpse. There was a change in him. You could see it. A set in the jaw. The squaring of the shoulders. The crew looked to him. He had assumed command.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thing 1, board the enemy ship and take down their reactor. Oliver, man the guns and concentrate all fire on their shields. Yusi, load the Penetrators and take out those missile rooms. Buy us some time to get our shields back online. Thing 2 protect that third reactor with your life. If we lose that last reactor our ship is dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For the Wolfpack! a-Wooooooooo!!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the first howl. It was a sound that would echo deep throughout Wolfpack. His packmates heard and took up the call.</p>

<p><em>a-Woooooooo!!!</em></p>
